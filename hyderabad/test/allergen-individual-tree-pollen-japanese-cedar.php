 </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>The Individual Allergen test for Tree Pollen Japanese Cedar is an investigation that checks for an allergic response to the pollen of the Japanese Cedar tree in your body. Pollen is a powdery substance released by trees, grasses, and weeds that fertilize plants of the same species. Unfortunately, some people's immune systems identify certain pollens as harmful, triggering an allergic reaction.
 </p>
<p>Japanese Cedar, known scientifically as Cryptomeria japonica, is a tree species native to East Asia, including Japan, China, and Taiwan. Its pollen is known to cause hay fever, which is characterized by symptoms like sneezing, itchy eyes, and a runny nose.
