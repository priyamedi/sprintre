It is a major risk factor for various health conditions including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, and certain types of cancer.</p>
<p>This test covers a wide range of parameters, from blood protein levels to electrolyte balance, to give a detailed picture of the body's current metabolic state. The parameters tested include Total Protein, Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL, Cholesterol to HDL Ratio, Triglycerides, Calcium, Creatinine, Uric Acid, Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Chloride), Fasting Glucose, Inorganic Phosphorous, T3, T4, TSH, Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Peripheral Smear (PS), and Complete Urine Examination (CUE).

</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should be consulted in case of abnormal test results?</h2>

    obesity-related diseases.</p>
<p>The Obesity Capsule I test offers a broad overview of an individual's metabolic health,

    highlight associated risks and conditions, aiding in early detection and management. Understanding your test
    results, in consultation with your healthcare provider, can guide lifestyle changes or interventions necessary for
    improved health and wellbeing. This proactive approach can ultimately lead to better health outcomes and quality of
    life.</p>
