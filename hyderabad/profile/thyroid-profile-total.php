<div>

<p>When it comes to maintaining your health and wellbeing, understanding the state of your thyroid is
crucial. Your thyroid, a small butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, plays a significant role in your body,
influencing your metabolism, growth, and development, and the functioning of vital organs, including
your heart. The Thyroid Profile Total is a group of tests that help understand how well your thyroid
gland is working. </p>
<p> The Thyroid Profile Total includes three essential tests: Total Triiodothyronine (T3), Total Thyroxine (T4),
and Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH). T3 and T4 are hormones produced by the thyroid gland, which
regulate metabolic processes in the body. TSH, produced by the pituitary gland, stimulates the thyroid
gland to produce T3 and T4.Understanding your thyroid's performance is crucial as irregularities can
lead to various conditions, including hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), hypothyroidism (underactive
thyroid), and thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland). This test is crucial for diagnosing thyroid
disorders, monitoring the treatment of thyroid diseases, and screening for thyroid diseases in newborns.</p>
