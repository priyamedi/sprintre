						<div>
<p>The Allergy Screening Panel for Pet Saliva, Hair, and Excreta is an essential diagnostic tool that helps
detect whether an individual is allergic to common household pets. Allergies to pets, more specifically to
cats and dogs, are widespread. The allergens causing these reactions are usually proteins found in the
pet's saliva, urine, and dander (dead skin cells), and these substances often stick to the animal's hair.</p>							
<p>This test works by detecting the presence of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in your blood.
When your body encounters an allergen it is sensitive to, it produces IgE antibodies against that
allergen. This process is a part of your body's immune response designed to neutralize the perceived
threat, but it also leads to the release of chemicals that cause allergy symptoms.Understanding these
allergens and detecting them early can significantly improve the quality of life for those affected by pet
allergies, as it aids in the development of an effective management and treatment plan.</p>							
							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Specific Instructions:</h2>
<p>You should inform your healthcare provider about all the medications and supplements you are
currently taking, as some of these may affect the test results. There is no need to fast or restrict water
consumption before this test.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the Allergy Screening Panel for Pet Saliva, Hair, and Excreta performed?</h2>
							<p>
The test involves a standard blood draw, typically from a vein in your arm. The blood sample is then
analyzed in a lab to determine the level of specific IgE antibodies.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is this test important?</h2>
<p>
If you have symptoms like sneezing, wheezing, itchy eyes, or a rash after contact with pets, this test can
confirm if you have an allergy to pet saliva, hair, or excreta. It can help determine the cause of your
symptoms and guide treatment decisions.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> When should I take this test?</h2>
<p>
Your doctor might recommend this test if you exhibit allergy symptoms after contact with pets. This can
include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, skin rash, itching, or swelling.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How often should I have this test done?</h2>
<p>
The frequency of testing is determined by your symptoms and your doctor's recommendations. If your
allergy symptoms are under control with treatment, you may not need repeat testing. However, if your
symptoms change or worsen, or if your treatments become less effective, retesting may be necessary.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What does a positive result mean?</h2>
<p>
A positive result indicates that you have a specific IgE antibody in your blood linked to pet allergens. This
means you're likely allergic to pet saliva, hair, or excreta.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What can affect my test results?</h2>
<p>
Certain medications can affect your test results. Always inform your doctor about all the medications
and supplements you are taking before having any diagnostic test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Who should I consult if my test results are abnormal?</h2>
<p>
If your test results are abnormal, you should consult an allergist. These specialists are trained to
diagnose and treat allergies.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
<p>
The reference values can vary depending on the lab performing the test. Generally, a value of less than
0.35 kU/L is considered normal.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can the Allergy Screening Panel for Pet Saliva, Hair, and Excreta detect all allergies?</h2>
<p>
No, this test is specific to pet allergies. It won't detect allergies to other substances like food, latex, or
certain medications.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can I reduce my allergy symptoms before getting the test results?</h2>
<p>
Yes, you may be able to reduce your symptoms by avoiding contact with pets, taking over-the-counter
antihistamines, using nasal sprays, or using decongestants. However, it's best to discuss these options
with your doctor.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What should I do if I am allergic to pets, but I have pets at home?</h2>
<p>
If you're allergic to pets, it may be necessary to re-home them. If that's not possible, you can reduce
your symptoms by keeping pets out of your bedroom, washing your hands after petting them, using a
high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifier, and regularly cleaning your home.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can allergies be cured?</h2>
<p>
While there is no cure for allergies, they can be managed effectively through avoidance of known
allergens and use of medications. Some people also undergo immunotherapy (allergy shots) to reduce
their sensitivity to allergens.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Are pet allergies hereditary?</h2>
<p>
There is a genetic predisposition to developing allergies, so if your parents have allergies, you are at a
higher risk. However, just because you have a family history of allergies doesn't mean you will develop
them.</p>
<p>Understanding your body’s allergic responses can significantly improve the management and treatment
of your symptoms. With an Allergy Screening Panel for Pet Saliva, Hair, and Excreta, you can gain
valuable insights into your allergies, allowing you to make informed decisions about your health. It’s
crucial to remember that if your test results are abnormal, you should consult a specialist to determine
the best course of action.</p>
