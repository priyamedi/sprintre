								<p>The Allergen, Individual - Animal Cow Dander Diagnostic Test is a critical test that helps determine if an individual has an allergic reaction to cow dander. This test is particularly useful for people who frequently interact with cows, like dairy farmers, or individuals residing in rural environments. The test identifies and measures the levels of specific antibodies in your blood, produced as a reaction to exposure to cow dander.</p>
								<p>Allergies, an overreaction of the immune system to usually harmless substances, are prevalent and can significantly affect a person's lifestyle and overall health. When your body encounters an allergen, such as cow dander, the immune system reacts by producing antibodies against the allergen. This reaction often results in symptoms that can range from mild, such as itching or sneezing, to severe conditions that could potentially be life-threatening.</p>
