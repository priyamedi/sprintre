<div class="post-text">
<p>The TEL/AML - Qualitative PCR Diagnostic Test is a laboratory procedure used to detect the presence of a specific type of genetic rearrangement. This involves the fusion of two genes, the TEL (also known as ETV6) and the AML1 (also known as RUNX1). This particular genetic fusion is often associated with certain types of leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). </p>
<p>The presence of the TEL/AML fusion gene doesn't necessarily mean a person has leukemia, but it is a strong risk factor and is often used in conjunction with other tests to confirm a diagnosis. The test involves analyzing a sample of your blood using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a technique that amplifies small amounts of DNA to make it easier to study. </p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the TEL/AML -Qualitative PCR Test important?</h2>
<p>This test is important because it aids in diagnosing specific types of leukemia, and helps in determining the most
	effective treatment plan. It can also be used to monitor response to treatment and detect any possible recurrence of
	the disease.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Do I need to fast before this test?</h2>
<p>No, fasting is not required for this test. You can continue your regular diet and medication schedule unless
	instructed otherwise by your healthcare provider.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should I get this test?</h2>
<p>Your doctor may recommend this test if you have symptoms of leukemia, such as fatigue, fever, weight loss, or
	frequent infections. It might also be ordered if you've already been diagnosed with leukemia and your doctor needs
	to determine the specific type or monitor your response to treatment.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does this test measure?</h2>
<p>This test detects the presence of the TEL/AML fusion gene in your blood, which is often associated with certain types
	of leukemia.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I get tested?</h2>
<p>The frequency of testing depends on your health condition and the treatment plan recommended by your doctor. Your
	doctor might order this test at diagnosis, during treatment to monitor response, and after treatment to detect any
	potential recurrence.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
<p>In a healthy individual, the TEL/AML fusion gene is not typically present. However, detecting it does not necessarily
	mean a person has leukemia, as it can occasionally be found in healthy people.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should I take before this test?</h2>
<p>No specific precautions are necessary. Continue your regular diet and medication schedule unless otherwise instructed
	by your doctor.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the levels of TEL/AML?</h2>
<p>The presence of the TEL/AML fusion gene is typically associated with the development of certain types of leukemia.
	Factors such as age, exposure to certain chemicals, and a history of certain genetic disorders can increase the risk
	of developing leukemia.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult if my test values are abnormal?</h2>
<p>If your test results are abnormal, you should consult a hematologist or an oncologist, doctors who specialize in
	blood disorders and cancer respectively.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with this test?</h2>
<p>The risks associated with this test are minimal and are similar to those of a regular blood draw, including mild
	discomfort or bruising at the injection site.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can medication affect the results of this test?</h2>
<p>Certain medications might affect the results of this test. Always inform your doctor about any medications,
	supplements, or therapies you are currently undergoing.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test be used to monitor the effectiveness of leukemia treatment?</h2>
<p>Yes, this test can be used to monitor response to treatment and detect any potential recurrence of the disease.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the TEL/AML fusion gene be found in healthy people?</h2>
<p>Yes, while rare, the TEL/AML fusion gene can occasionally be found in healthy people. However, its presence is
	typically associated with the development of certain types of leukemia.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What other tests might be performed along with the TEL/AML -Qualitative PCR Test?</h2>
<p>Your doctor might order other tests to confirm a diagnosis of leukemia, such as a complete blood count (CBC), bone
	marrow biopsy, or other genetic tests.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can lifestyle changes affect the presence of the TEL/AML fusion gene?</h2>
<p>No, lifestyle changes won't affect the presence of this fusion gene as it is a genetic alteration. However, a healthy
	lifestyle can support overall health and well-being during treatment for leukemia.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can children also undergo the TEL/AML -Qualitative PCR Test?</h2>
<p>Yes, children can also undergo this test. In fact, TEL/AML fusion gene is often associated with childhood acute
	lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How accurate is the TEL/AML -Qualitative PCR Test?</h2>
<p>The test is highly accurate. PCR technology is known for its sensitivity and specificity in detecting genetic
	material, making it a reliable tool for diagnosing and monitoring conditions like leukemia.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the results of the TEL/AML -Qualitative PCR Test be immediately available?</h2>
<p>The turnaround time for the test results is typically 3 to 7 days. However, it may vary depending on the laboratory.
</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">If I tested positive for the TEL/AML fusion gene, does it mean I will develop leukemia?
</h2>
<p>Not necessarily. While the presence of the TEL/AML fusion gene is associated with certain types of leukemia, not
	everyone who has this fusion gene will develop the disease. It is, however, a significant risk factor and needs to
	be closely monitored.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can I prepare my child for this test?</h2>
<p>Like any other blood tests, drawing blood can cause slight discomfort or fear, especially in children. Comfort your child, and explain to them why the test is needed in a language they can understand. You may also distract them during the blood draw with a toy or a game.</p>
<p>Understanding the TEL/AML -Qualitative PCR Diagnostic Test, its necessity, and its results is essential in diagnosing and managing leukemia. The knowledge provides insights and helps guide the path towards the most suitable treatment. Always remember to discuss the results with your healthcare provider to fully understand your medical condition. In case you have any queries or concerns, do not hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider.</p>
