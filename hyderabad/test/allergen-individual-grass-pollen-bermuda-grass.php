						<div class="post-text">
							<p>Bermuda grass, scientifically known as Cynodon dactylon, is a widely used grass for
								lawns, golf courses, and sports fields. It is known for its hardiness and ability to
								grow in various types of soil. However, Bermuda grass is also known for producing pollen
								that can cause allergic reactions in some individuals. The Allergen, Individual - Grass
								Pollen Bermuda Grass test is designed to diagnose an allergy to Bermuda grass pollen by
								detecting the presence of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood.
							</p>
							<p>
								Pollen is a powdery substance that is produced by various plants, including grasses like
								Bermuda grass, as part of their reproductive process. While pollen is usually harmless,
								in some individuals, the immune system mistakenly identifies it as a threat and produces
								IgE antibodies to fight against it. This reaction leads to the release of chemicals that
								cause allergy symptoms.
