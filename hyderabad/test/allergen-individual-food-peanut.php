<div class="post-text">
<p>Peanuts are one of the most common triggers of severe food-induced allergic reactions. Although they are enjoyed by many and are a staple in various cuisines, some individuals experience allergies to peanuts. The Allergen, Individual - Food Peanut test is used to identify and confirm an allergy to peanuts. This blood test measures the levels of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which are produced in response to proteins found in peanuts.</p>
<p>Allergic reactions to peanuts can range from mild to severe and can be life-threatening in the case of anaphylaxis. Peanut allergies are especially prevalent among children, but adults can also develop this allergy. Being aware of a peanut allergy is imperative for managing and preventing allergic reactions.
