<div class="post-text">
<p><strong>Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)</strong> is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, acting as a cushion and
providing essential nutrients. The Routine Examination with Cytology - <strong>CSF test</strong> is a diagnostic procedure
that examines the cells present in the CSF to detect infections, <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/heath-checkups/cancer-screening"><b style="color:#2C53A5">cancers </b></a>, or other <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/our-services/neurology/"><b style="color:#2C53A5">neurological</b></a> conditions.
</p>
<p>The test involves a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) where a needle is inserted into the lower back to collect
a sample of CSF. The sample is then sent to the <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/our-services/laboratory/"><b style="color:#2C53A5">laboratory</b></a>
 where it undergoes a series of examinations.
The cytology aspect of the test involves studying the form and structure of cells to identify any
abnormalities, which could indicate disease.  </p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What conditions can a Routine Examination with Cytology - CSF help diagnose?</h2>
	<p>
This test can help diagnose a wide range of conditions affecting the nervous system, such as meningitis,
encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors. It can also help detect <ahref="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/our-services/nuclear-medicine/pet-ct-scan/"><b style="color:#2C53A5">cancers</b></a>
 that have spread to the
brain or spinal cord.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Is the collection procedure for this test painful?</h2>
<p>
While the procedure might cause discomfort, the area is numbed with a local anesthetic to minimize
pain. After the procedure, you may feel some soreness at the puncture site.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How is the CSF sample collected?</h2>
<p>
The CSF sample is collected through a procedure called a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, where a thin
needle is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to draw out fluid.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What does abnormal cytology results mean?</h2>
<p>
Abnormal results may suggest the presence of <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms/frequent-infections"><b style="color:#2C53A5">infection</b></a>, inflammation, or malignant cells. Depending on

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What other tests might be ordered along with this test?</h2>
<p>
Depending on your symptoms, other tests such as CSF protein, CSF glucose, or CSF cell count may also
be ordered along with this test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can I go home immediately after the sample collection procedure?</h2>
<p>
After a lumbar puncture, you will typically be asked to lie flat for a short period to minimize the risk of
headache, a common side effect. Your healthcare provider will advise you on when it's safe to go home.</p>
