						<p>Wilson's Disease Panel is a comprehensive set of tests designed to diagnose Wilson's disease, a rare inherited disorder that causes copper to accumulate in your liver, brain, and other vital organs.</p>
						<p>This panel includes a Complete Blood Count (CBC), measurement of Ceruloplasmin (a protein that binds copper in the blood), Serum and Urine Copper levels, Serum total protein, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), Bilirubin, and Random Blood Sugar (RBS). Each of these tests plays a crucial role in diagnosing and managing Wilson's disease.</p>
