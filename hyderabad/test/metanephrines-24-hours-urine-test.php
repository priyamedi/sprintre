<div class="post-text">
<p>The Metanephrines - 24 Hours Urine test is a type of medical examination that looks at metanephrines
levels in your urine collected over a 24-hour period. Metanephrines are substances that come about
when your body breaks down catecholamines, which include hormones like adrenaline (epinephrine)
and noradrenaline (norepinephrine).
</p>
<p> The human body produces these hormones in response to stress, and they help in functions such as
opening up airways, contracting blood vessels, and increasing heart rates. However, certain medical
conditions can cause your body to produce too much of these hormones, leading to an excess of
metanephrines. A 24-hour urine metanephrines test can help in diagnosing these conditions.</p>
