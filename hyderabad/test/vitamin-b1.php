								<p>Vitamin B1, also known as Thiamine, plays an essential role in converting food into energy. It is critical for healthy skin, hair, muscles, and brain and is necessary for proper nerve function. A Vitamin B1 test measures the amount of thiamine in the blood to check for a deficiency that can lead to various health problems such as beriberi or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.</p>
								<p>Deficiency of Vitamin B1 can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, poor memory, sleep disturbances, anorexia, and abdominal discomfort. A prolonged deficiency may result in beriberi, a disease characterized by anemia, paralysis, and swollen tissues.</p>
