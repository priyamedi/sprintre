<div class="post-text">
<p>Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) is a complex group of malignancies that vary in their behavior and response to treatment. They stem from cells of the lymphatic system, an essential part of the body's immune system. The diagnosis, classification, and appropriate therapeutic approach for NHL require specific testing, including the use of immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC is an invaluable technique in pathology that utilizes antibodies to detect specific proteins in the cells of a tissue sample, helping to define the exact type of NHL.
 </p>
<p>This IHC diagnostic panel for NHL encompasses an array of markers, which are chosen reflexively based on the tumor's morphological characteristics. These markers include LCA, CD20, CD79a, PAX5, CD3, CD5, CD4, CD8, CD7, CD25, CD123, Oct2, BOB1, MUM-1, Bcl2, Bcl6, CD10, CD23, CD138, kappa, lambda, CD56, CD57, CD68, CD138, CD15, CD30, TdT, CD99, MPO, CD117, Granzyme B, cyclin D1, EBV, CD2, ALK-1, Perforin, TIA1, and Langerin.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the importance of this test?
 </h2>
	<p>This test is critical for diagnosing and classifying Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, which is essential for planning the appropriate treatment strategy.
 </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required for this test?
 </h2>
	<p>No, fasting is not required for this test as it is performed on a tissue sample collected via biopsy.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does this test measure?</h2>
<p>This test uses specific antibodies to identify different proteins in a tissue sample. These proteins can provide important information about the subtype of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should I get this test?</h2>
<p>Your doctor will recommend this test if they suspect you have Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma based on symptoms, clinical findings, and other diagnostic tests.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done?</h2>
<p>This test is typically done once to diagnose and classify Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. However, it may be repeated if needed, for example, in the event of a relapse.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
<p>As this test aims to identify specific proteins in the cells, it does not have standard "normal" values. The results are interpreted by a pathologist based on the presence or absence of these proteins.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should I take before this test?</h2>
<p>There are no specific precautions needed for this test. Follow your healthcare provider's instructions regarding the biopsy procedure.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the levels of these markers?</h2>
<p>The expression of these proteins can be influenced by the subtype of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and the particular genetic mutations within the cancer cells.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult in case of abnormal results?</h2>
<p>Abnormal results should be discussed with your oncologist or hematologist who can guide you through the next steps in your treatment plan.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the test results vary depending on gender or age?</h2>
<p>No, the test results depend on the presence of certain proteins indicative of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, not the age or gender of the patient.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What specific preparations are required for this test?</h2>
<p>No specific preparation is needed for this test. It is performed on a tissue sample usually obtained through a biopsy procedure.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test diagnose all types of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma?</h2>
<p>This test can identify a wide range of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma subtypes. However, additional tests may be required for a complete diagnosis and classification.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What if the results are inconclusive?</h2>
<p>If the results are inconclusive, your doctor may recommend additional testing or repeat the biopsy procedure to obtain a new sample.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can lifestyle changes affect the results of this test?</h2>
<p>No, the results of this test are not influenced by lifestyle factors. They are a reflection of the underlying disease process.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the biopsy for this test performed?</h2>
<p>The biopsy procedure involves taking a small tissue sample from the suspected area. This procedure is usually performed under local or general anesthesia.</p>

<p>Understanding the type of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma is vital for determining the most effective treatment plan. The IHC final diagnostic panel is a sophisticated tool that aids healthcare professionals in diagnosing and classifying NHL, leading to more personalized and targeted treatment strategies. Always discuss the test results with your healthcare provider to understand the implications for your treatment plan and overall health.</p>
