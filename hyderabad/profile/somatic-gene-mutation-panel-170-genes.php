<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required for the Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes test?</h2>
<p>No, fasting is not required for this test.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does the Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes test measure?</h2>
<p>The test detects mutations in 170 different genes. Mutations in these genes may be associated with various diseases, most notably cancers.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I get the Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes test done?</h2>
<p>This test is typically only done when directed by a doctor, usually in response to specific symptoms or as part of cancer treatment planning.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for the Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes test?</h2>
<p>The normal result would be the absence of mutations in the tested genes. However, interpretation of results should always be done by a healthcare professional.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should I take before and after the Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes test?</h2>
<p>There are no specific precautions needed for this test. However, understanding that genetic testing can have psychological impacts, it may be beneficial to have genetic counseling before and after the test.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are some modifiable factors that can affect the Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes test results?</h2>
<p>As this test is genetic, lifestyle factors generally do not affect the results.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What non-modifiable factors can affect the test results?</h2>
<p>Non-modifiable factors include the genetic makeup of an individual which is inherited and cannot be changed.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> If my test results are abnormal, whom should I consult?</h2>
<p>You should consult your doctor or a genetic counselor for an in-depth interpretation of the results.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can medical conditions affect the Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes test results?</h2>
<p>Yes, various diseases, most notably certain cancers, can cause mutations detected by this test.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What do detected mutations in the Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes test indicate?</h2>
<p>Detected mutations may indicate an increased risk or presence of certain diseases, including cancer.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can medications affect the Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes test results?</h2>
<p>No, medications do not affect your genetic makeup and thus will not influence the results of this test.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What steps can I take to improve my test results?</h2>
<p>Since this test measures genetic mutations, there are no specific steps to improve the results. However, living a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of diseases associated with these mutations.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Are certain individuals more likely to have abnormal Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes test results?</h2>
<p>Individuals with a family history of diseases associated with these 170 genes, such as certain cancers, may be more likely to have abnormal results.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can the Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes test be performed at home?</h2>
<p>No, the test requires a blood draw or tissue biopsy, which should be performed by a trained healthcare professional.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What does a sudden change in my gene panel indicate?</h2>
<p>Genetic makeup remains stable. However, this test focuses on somatic mutations which occur in body cells and can change over time. These changes may indicate disease progression or response to treatment.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can I maintain a healthy gene profile?</h2>
<p>While you can't change your genetic makeup, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help to prevent diseases associated with these gene mutations.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the risks associated with the Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes test?</h2>
<p>The main risks associated with this test are related to the blood draw or biopsy procedure. Also, there may be psychological impact from learning about potential genetic risks.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How reliable is the Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes test?</h2>
<p>This test is highly reliable for detecting mutations in the specific genes it targets. However, it does not eliminate the possibility of having other genetic conditions not covered by this panel.</p>

<p>The Somatic Gene Mutation Panel - 170 Genes is an effective tool in precision medicine, particularly for diagnosing and treating various cancers. Understanding the role of these genes in disease development and progression can guide more targeted and effective treatment plans. Always consult with your healthcare provider if you have any concerns or questions about this test.</p>
