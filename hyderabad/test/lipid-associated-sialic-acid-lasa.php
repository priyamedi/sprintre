<div class="post-text">
<p>Lipid Associated Sialic Acid (LASA) Test is a blood test that measures the levels of sialic acid associated with lipids in the blood. Sialic acid is a carbohydrate that is often found attached to proteins and lipids on the cell surface. Elevated levels of LASA can be an indication of certain types of cancers, especially in the stomach and large intestine.</p>

<p>Yes, LASA levels can fluctuate due to various factors, including medication, inflammation, and the progression of
    cancer.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can lifestyle changes impact LASA levels?</h2>
<p>There is no direct evidence that lifestyle changes can impact LASA levels, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle is
    always beneficial, especially for individuals undergoing cancer treatment.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What other tests might be performed along with the LASA Test?</h2>
<p>Other tests that might be performed in conjunction with the LASA Test include complete blood count, cancer antigen
    tests, and imaging tests.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can infections affect LASA levels?</h2>
<p>Yes, infections and inflammatory conditions can also cause elevated LASA levels.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the blood sample collected for the LASA Test?</h2>
<p>A blood sample is collected by drawing blood from a vein, typically in the arm, using a needle.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is this test only for cancer patients?</h2>
