<div class="post-text">
<p>The Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) test is a vital diagnostic tool used to measure the levels of SHBG in your blood. SHBG is a protein produced by the liver that binds to three sex hormones found in both men and women: estrogen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and testosterone. SHBG carries these hormones throughout your blood.</p>

<p>The balance of these hormones plays a crucial role in reproductive health, sexual development, and function. Abnormal levels of SHBG can result in various conditions, including hypogonadism, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and certain types of cancer. Thus, the SHBG test is essential in diagnosing these conditions and assisting in their management.</p>
