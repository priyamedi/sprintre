								<p>The PDGFRA Mutation Analysis is a specialized genetic test that detects mutations in the PDGFRA gene in tumor tissue. The PDGFRA gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control cell growth and division. Mutations in this gene are associated with certain types of solid tumors, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).</p>
								<p>Understanding the results of this test can be particularly useful in managing your health. It can help your doctor confirm a diagnosis, understand the severity of the condition, and guide treatment decisions, including the use of targeted therapies.</p>
