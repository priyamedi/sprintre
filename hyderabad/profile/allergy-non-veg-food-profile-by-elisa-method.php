								used in immunology to detect the presence of an antibody or an antigen in a sample. In
								the context of food allergies, the test is used to measure the antibodies in the blood
								that are produced in response to specific non-veg food allergens.

								chicken, beef, and seafood like fish, shrimp, etc.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do the results mean? </h2>
							<p>A higher level of antibodies to a specific non-vegetarian food indicates an allergy to
								that food. Your doctor will interpret the results and advise on the necessary steps for
								management.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can I manage my diet if I am allergic to certain non-veg foods?
							</h2>

								avoids the allergens.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are food allergies permanent? </h2>
							<p>Not always. Some people outgrow their food allergies, especially if they developed them
								as children. However, some food allergies can be lifelong.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What should I do in case of an allergic reaction? </h2>
							<p>In case of an allergic reaction, itâ€™s important to avoid the allergen and take
								antihistamine medication if the reaction is mild. For severe reactions, seek emergency
								medical help immediately.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I take allergy medications before the test to prevent allergic
								reactions? </h2>
							<p>You should not take allergy medications before the test without consulting your doctor,
