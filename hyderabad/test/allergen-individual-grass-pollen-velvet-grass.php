<div class="post-text">
<p>Velvet Grass, known scientifically as Holcus lanatus, is a perennial grass that is found in meadows, grasslands, and lawns. It is often seen as an ornamental grass in gardens. Like other grasses, Velvet Grass produces pollen that can be a common allergen for some individuals. When Velvet Grass is in its blooming season, generally during the late spring and early summer, it releases pollen into the air. Some individuals’ immune systems overreact to this pollen, considering it to be harmful, even though it is not. This overreaction results in the production of antibodies and the release of histamines, which cause allergic symptoms. </p>
