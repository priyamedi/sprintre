								<p>The Peritoneal Dialysis Adequacy Test is a set of tests that measure how well peritoneal dialysis is working. Peritoneal dialysis is a treatment for kidney failure that uses the lining of your abdomen, or belly, to filter your blood. This test measures the levels of certain substances in both your blood and the dialysate (the fluid used in peritoneal dialysis) to determine how effectively waste products are being removed from your body.</p>
								<p>Understanding the results of this test can be particularly useful in managing your health. It can help your doctor adjust your dialysis treatment if necessary to ensure that it's effectively removing waste products from your body.</p>
