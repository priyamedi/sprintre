<div class="post-text">
<p>Preimplantation Genetic Screening (PGS) is a form of preimplantation genetic testing that examines the chromosomal structure of an embryo to identify any genetic abnormalities. This particular test involves a biopsy on the 5th day after fertilization on 12 embryos. This is typically performed when multiple viable embryos have been produced during an In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) cycle.</p>

<p>The purpose of PGS is to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy and reduce the risk of a miscarriage by only transferring chromosomally normal embryos. This method of screening can be particularly beneficial for couples with a history of genetic disorders, recurrent miscarriages, failed IVF cycles, or in cases of advanced maternal age.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the purpose of PGS testing?</h2>
<p>The main purpose of PGS testing is to identify any chromosomal abnormalities in embryos before they are transferred
    to the uterus. This can increase the chances of a successful pregnancy and reduce the risk of miscarriage.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the biopsy performed?</h2>
<p>The biopsy is performed by an embryologist in a laboratory setting. On the 5th day of development, a small number of
    cells are carefully removed from each embryo. These cells are then analyzed to identify any chromosomal
    abnormalities.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Who should consider PGS testing?</h2>
<p>PGS testing can be considered by anyone undergoing IVF, particularly those with a history of recurrent miscarriages,
    failed IVF cycles, genetic disorders, or those of advanced maternal age. However, the decision to undergo PGS
    testing should be made in consultation with a fertility specialist.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does it mean when an embryo is chromosomally normal?</h2>
<p>A chromosomally normal (or euploid) embryo is one that contains the correct number of chromosomes - 46 in total, 23
    from the egg and 23 from the sperm. Embryos with the correct number of chromosomes are more likely to result in a
    successful pregnancy and a healthy baby.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What happens if an abnormality is detected?</h2>
<p>If an abnormality is detected, that particular embryo would not be selected for transfer. The decision to proceed
    with the transfer of any remaining normal embryos would be made in consultation with your fertility specialist.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can PGS testing be used to select the sex of the baby?</h2>
<p>Yes, because PGS testing involves the analysis of chromosomes, it can identify the sex of the embryos. However, it's
    important to note that the primary goal of PGS testing is to identify chromosomally normal embryos, and not to
    select the sex of the baby.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long does it take to receive the results?</h2>
<p>The results of PGS testing are usually available within 7-10 days. During this waiting period, the embryos are
    cryopreserved (frozen) and stored safely until the results are available.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How accurate is PGS testing?</h2>
<p>PGS testing is a highly accurate method of detecting chromosomal abnormalities. However, like all tests, it's not
    100% accurate and there's a small chance that the test could miss an abnormality or produce a false-positive result.
</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can PGS testing harm the embryos?</h2>
<p>The biopsy process involves removing a small number of cells from each embryo, which does not typically harm the
    embryos. However, the procedure should be performed by a skilled embryologist to minimize any potential risk.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the risks associated with PGS testing?</h2>
<p>The main risk associated with PGS testing is the potential for damage to the embryos during the biopsy process.
    However, this risk is minimal when the procedure is performed by a skilled embryologist.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Does PGS testing guarantee a successful pregnancy?</h2>
<p>While PGS testing can significantly increase the chances of a successful pregnancy by ensuring only chromosomally
    normal embryos are transferred, it does not guarantee a pregnancy. Other factors, such as the health and age of the
    woman, also play important roles.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can PGS testing prevent all genetic disorders?</h2>
<p>PGS testing can identify a wide range of chromosomal abnormalities, but it cannot detect all genetic disorders. Some
    genetic disorders are caused by single gene mutations that are not detectable by PGS testing.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can PGS testing be performed on frozen embryos?</h2>
<p>Yes, PGS testing can be performed on frozen embryos. The embryos would be thawed, biopsied, and then refrozen until
    the results are available.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Does PGS testing increase the chance of having twins or multiples?</h2>
<p>No, PGS testing itself does not increase the chance of having twins or multiples. However, the transfer of multiple
    embryos can increase the chance of a multiple pregnancy.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is PGS testing different from Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD)?</h2>
<p>While both PGS and PGD involve genetic testing of embryos, they are used for different purposes. PGS is used to
    screen for chromosomal abnormalities in embryos, while PGD is used to identify specific genetic disorders in embryos
    when one or both parents are known to be carriers of the disorder.</p>
