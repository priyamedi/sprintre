							<p>Hepatitis B, a potentially serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV),
								is a global health concern. In some people, particularly those infected as infants or
								young children, the disease can become chronic, leading to liver failure, liver cancer,
								or cirrhosis — a condition that causes permanent scarring of the liver. The Hepatitis B
								Surface Antigen (HBsAg) - Confirmation (Neutralisation Test) is crucial in detecting and
								confirming the presence of the hepatitis B virus in your body.
							</p>
							<p>
								HBsAg is the first marker that appears in the blood following infection with hepatitis
								B. Its presence means a person is infectious and can spread the virus to others. A
								confirmatory test is essential to avoid false positives, which can occur due to various
								reasons, such as the presence of certain substances in the blood. The neutralisation
								test is a type of confirmation test for Hepatitis B, used to ascertain whether an
								initially positive result for HBsAg is indeed true.

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is a Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) - Confirmation
									(Neutralisation Test)?</h2>
								<p>The Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) - Confirmation (Neutralisation Test) is a
									blood test that confirms the presence of HBsAg in the blood, which indicates a
									current infection with Hepatitis B.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the HBsAg Confirmation test done?</h2>
								<p>This test is performed to confirm a positive HBsAg screening test. It helps rule out
									any false-positive results and conclusively diagnose a Hepatitis B infection.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does a positive HBsAg confirmation test result mean?</h2>
								<p>A positive result indicates that a person is currently infected with the hepatitis B
									virus and can spread the virus to others.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the HBsAg confirmation test performed?</h2>
								<p>The test is done on a blood sample, which is drawn from a vein in your arm. This
									sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the importance of getting this test done?</h2>
								<p>Getting this test done helps confirm a Hepatitis B infection, enabling timely
									treatment and preventing the spread of the disease to others. It's crucial in
									managing the infection and mitigating potential complications.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Do I need to fast for the HBsAg confirmation test?</h2>
								<p>No, there's no need for fasting for the HBsAg confirmation test. It can be done at
									any time of the day.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors may affect the levels of HBsAg?</h2>
								<p>Certain medications and the stage of the Hepatitis B infection can affect HBsAg
									levels.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I get tested for HBsAg?</h2>
								<p>The frequency of the test depends on your health status, risk factors, and whether
									you've been previously diagnosed with Hepatitis B. Your doctor can provide the best
									advice on this.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should be consulted in case of a positive HBsAg
									confirmation test?</h2>
								<p>You should consult a hepatologist or an infectious disease specialist in case of a
									positive HBsAg confirmation test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can Hepatitis B be cured if detected early?</h2>
								<p>While there's no definitive cure for Hepatitis B, early detection and treatment can
									help control the virus, prevent its spread to others, and significantly reduce the
									risk of complications like liver disease.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How can I prevent Hepatitis B infection?</h2>
								<p>Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent Hepatitis B infection. Practicing
									safe sex, avoiding sharing needles, and avoiding direct contact with blood and
									bodily fluids are also essential preventive measures.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Is Hepatitis B common?</h2>
								<p>Hepatitis B is common in many parts of the world, especially in Asia and Africa.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can Hepatitis B cause liver cancer?</h2>
								<p>Yes, chronic Hepatitis B infection can lead to liver cancer in some individuals.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can a person be infected with Hepatitis B more than once?</h2>
								<p>Once you recover from Hepatitis B infection, your body generally has developed
									immunity against it, protecting you from future infections. However, in cases of
									weak or compromised immune systems, reinfection may occur.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What should be done after being diagnosed with Hepatitis B?
								</h2>
								<p>If diagnosed with Hepatitis B, it is essential to follow your doctor's instructions,
									take prescribed medications, and make lifestyle changes such as avoiding alcohol, to
									manage the infection effectively.</p>
								<p>Being informed about your hepatitis B status is invaluable. Early detection through
									tests such as the Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Confirmation can mean timely
									treatment, potentially preventing severe liver conditions or spreading the infection
									to others. Discuss your results with your doctor and follow any recommendations or
									treatments they might suggest. By being proactive about your health, you are taking
									steps to ensure a better quality of life for yourself and those around you.</p>
