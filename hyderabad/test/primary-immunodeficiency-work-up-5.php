<div class="post-text">

<p>The Primary Immunodeficiency Work-Up-5 is a thorough diagnostic tool used to evaluate the functioning of the immune system and identify potential primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs). This test comprises an assessment of different lymphocyte types - B cells, T cells, and Natural Killer (NK) cells, and gauges the levels of immunoglobulins - IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE. Furthermore, it includes Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD) Screening and Neutrophil Burst Oxidase Assay for Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) screening, essential for assessing the body's ability to fight infections.</p>

<p>PIDs are a group of more than 400 rare, chronic disorders in which part of the immune system is missing or functions improperly. These disorders, usually caused by genetic defects, can result in increased susceptibility to infections, autoimmune diseases, and certain types of cancers. The Primary Immunodeficiency Work-Up-5 is crucial for the early detection and effective management of these disorders, leading to improved patient outcomes.</p>
