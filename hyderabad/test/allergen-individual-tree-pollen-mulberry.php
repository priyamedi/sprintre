<div class="post-text">
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Tree Pollen Mulberry test is a diagnostic examination that measures the body's immunological response to the pollen from Mulberry trees. These trees are widely spread across temperate and subtropical regions around the world, with some varieties known to produce high amounts of pollen during the flowering season.
 </p>
<p>Many individuals develop an allergy to this pollen, leading to symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, congestion, itchy or watery eyes, and other classic signs of allergic rhinitis or "hay fever". In some cases, the reaction can be severe enough to trigger asthma attacks.
