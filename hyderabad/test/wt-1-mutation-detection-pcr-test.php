						<p>The WT-1 Mutation Detection - PCR Test is a genetic test that screens for mutations in the WT1 gene. WT1 gene mutations are associated with several types of diseases, most notably Wilms tumor, a rare kidney cancer that primarily affects children.</p>
						<p>This test uses Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology to amplify and detect specific segments of DNA in your blood sample, allowing for the identification of alterations in the WT1 gene. Changes in this gene can lead to abnormal protein function and cause diseases like Wilms tumor, Denys-Drash syndrome, and Frasier syndrome.</p>

					<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the WT-1 Mutation Detection - PCR Test important?</h2>
<p>The test is essential for early detection of diseases associated with WT1 gene mutations, such as certain types of
    kidney disease and cancer, enabling timely intervention and treatment.</p>
	<div class="mt-3"></div>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required for this test?</h2>
<p>No, fasting is not required for this test.</p>

						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What type of sample is needed for this test?</h2>
						<p>A blood sample is used for this test.</p>
						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should I consider getting this test?</h2>
						<p>If there's a history of kidney disease, kidney cancer, or related syndromes in your family, or if your child has
							symptoms of these conditions, you should consider this test.</p>
						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does this test measure?</h2>
						<p>The test checks for mutations in the WT1 gene, which is associated with the development of several diseases when
							altered.</p>
						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done?</h2>
						<p>This test is typically only done once, as a diagnostic tool, unless your healthcare provider suggests otherwise.</p>
						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are normal results for this test?</h2>
						<p>Normal results would show no mutations in the WT1 gene.</p>
						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should I take before this test?</h2>
						<p>There are no specific precautions you need to take before this test.</p>
						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors could affect the test results?</h2>
						<p><b>Modifiable Factors: </b>There are no modifiable factors as this is a genetic test and the results are based on your genes.</p>
						<p><b>Nonmodifiable Factors: </b>Family history of diseases associated with WT1 mutations.</p>
						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What should I do if the test results are abnormal?</h2>
						<p>If your test results show a WT1 gene mutation, consult with your healthcare provider or a genetic counselor for
							guidance on the next steps.</p>
						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult if my test results show a mutation?</h2>
						<p>You should consult a genetic counselor or a specialist who deals with the condition associated with the specific
							mutation, such as a nephrologist for kidney-related issues or an oncologist for cancer-related concerns.</p>
						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is there any specific preparation required for this test?</h2>
						<p>No, there is no specific preparation required for this test.</p>
						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can medication affect the test results?</h2>
						<p>No, medication does not typically affect the results of this genetic test.</p>
						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can WT-1 gene mutations be treated?</h2>
						<p>While gene mutations themselves can't be corrected, the diseases they cause can often be treated or managed. It's
							important to discuss this with your healthcare provider.</p>
						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can these mutations be passed on to my children?</h2>
						<p>Yes, some WT-1 gene mutations can be inherited. It's advisable to seek genetic counseling if you're planning a family and have a known WT-1 mutation.</p>
						<p>Understanding if you have a WT-1 mutation can be a critical component of your health journey. It enables early intervention and appropriate management of associated diseases. Always remember that if you have a WT-1 mutation, it's vital to consult with a specialist for comprehensive management and potential treatment options.</p>
