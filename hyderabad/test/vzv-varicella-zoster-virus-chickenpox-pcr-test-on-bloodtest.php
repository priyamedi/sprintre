					<div class="post-text">
								<p>The VZV-Varicella Zoster Virus (Chicken pox) - PCR on Blood test is a diagnostic tool used to detect the presence of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the virus responsible for chickenpox and shingles, in your bloodstream. The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology allows for highly sensitive and specific detection of the virus. <br><br>
								Chickenpox is a common childhood illness characterized by a red, itchy rash, fever, and malaise. While it's usually a mild disease, complications can occur, particularly in adults, infants, and individuals with a compromised immune system. Early diagnosis and treatment can help alleviate symptoms and prevent the spread of the virus to others.	</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the VZV-Varicella Zoster Virus - PCR on Blood test done?</h2>
								<p>This test is done to confirm a diagnosis of chickenpox or shingles, especially in cases where the symptoms are atypical or severe.</p>
								
							
								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Do I need to fast before this test?</h2>
								<p>No, there is no need to fast before this test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What type of sample is used in this test?</h2>
								<p>A blood sample is used in this test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should I get this test?</h2>
								<p>You should get this test if you have symptoms suggestive of chickenpox or shingles, especially if they are severe or you are in a high-risk group.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does this test measure?</h2>
								<p>This test detects the presence of the varicella-zoster virus in your blood.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I get tested?</h2>
								<p>This test is usually only needed once to confirm a diagnosis. Further testing is usually not necessary unless complications are suspected.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
								<p>A negative result is normal and indicates that the varicella-zoster virus was not detected in your blood.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any precautions I need to take before this test?</h2>
								<p>There are no specific precautions you need to take before this test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors could affect the test results?</h2>
								<p>The timing of the test could affect the results. VZV is more likely to be detected in the blood during the active phase of the infection.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Who should I consult if my test results are positive?</h2>
								<p>If your test results are positive, you should consult an infectious disease specialist or your primary care doctor.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Do I need any specific preparation for this test?</h2>
								<p>No specific preparation is needed for this test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the modifiable factors affecting VZV infection?</h2>
								<p>Vaccination status is a modifiable factor affecting VZV infection. The chickenpox vaccine greatly reduces the risk of getting the disease.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the non-modifiable factors affecting VZV infection?</h2>
								<p>Age and immune system function are non-modifiable factors that affect the risk of VZV infection.</p>

								<p>The VZV-Varicella Zoster Virus (Chicken pox) - PCR on Blood test is a crucial tool for accurately diagnosing chickenpox and shingles. Early diagnosis can help alleviate symptoms, prevent complications, and stop the spread of the virus.</p>
