<div class="post-text">
<p>Zea Mays, better known as maize or corn, is a staple food crop grown worldwide. As part of its reproductive process, this grass species releases a significant amount of pollen into the environment, typically during the summer months. For some individuals, exposure to Zea Mays pollen can trigger an allergic reaction, with the immune system mistakenly identifying the pollen as a harmful invader. This immune response leads to the release of chemicals like histamines, which in turn cause the characteristic symptoms of an allergic reaction. </p>
