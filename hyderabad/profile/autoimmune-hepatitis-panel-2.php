<div class="post-text">
<p>Autoimmune Hepatitis Panel II provides an in-depth evaluation of autoimmune hepatitis, a disease
characterized by the body's immune system launching an attack on liver cells. This results in
inflammation and possible liver damage. The panel includes a range of antibodies that can point towards
different facets of autoimmune hepatitis, aiding in diagnosis, and treatment planning. Understanding
the ins and outs of this test can empower patients and medical professionals in managing liver health
effectively. </p>
<p> The Autoimmune Hepatitis Panel II uses an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to detect the presence of
different types of antibodies, including Anti-Mitochondrial Antibody M2 (AMA M2), M2-3E, Sp100,
Promyelocytic Leukaemia (PML), gp210, Anti-Liver Kidney Microsome Type 1 (Anti-LKM1), Liver Cytosol
Type 1 (LC1), Soluble Liver Antigen/Liver Pancreas (SLA/LP), and Ro52. These antibodies can signify
various forms of autoimmune hepatitis and related conditions, making this panel a comprehensive
diagnostic tool for autoimmune liver diseases.</p>
<p>Autoimmune hepatitis is categorized into two types based on the antibodies present. Type 1 is
associated with anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), Anti-Smooth Muscle Antibody (ASMA), and at times,
SLA/LP. Type 2, though less common, is signified by Anti-LKM1 and LC1 antibodies. Certain antibodies
like AMA M2, Sp100, gp210, and PML are primarily linked to primary biliary cholangitis, another
autoimmune liver disease. The detection of these antibodies through the Autoimmune Hepatitis Panel II
contributes to a more precise diagnosis and helps establish an appropriate treatment plan.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Why should I take the Autoimmune Hepatitis Panel II test?</h2>
	<p>
Your doctor may order the Autoimmune Hepatitis Panel II if you are showing signs of liver disease, such
as jaundice, fatigue, or discomfort in the abdomen, and autoimmune hepatitis is suspected.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What does it mean if I test positive for specific antibodies in the panel?</h2>
<p>
Positive results for different antibodies indicate different types of autoimmune hepatitis or related
conditions. For example, positive Anti-LKM1 and LC1 antibodies are suggestive of Type 2 Autoimmune
Hepatitis.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required before taking this test?</h2>
<p>

No, there is no need to fast before taking the Autoimmune Hepatitis Panel II test. You can continue with
your usual diet and fluid intake.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the method used for this test?</h2>
<p>
The Autoimmune Hepatitis Panel II uses an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). It's a lab technique that
detects specific antibodies in your blood.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What happens if the test results come back abnormal?</h2>
<p>
Abnormal results suggest the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis or related conditions. However,
further investigations will be needed to confirm the diagnosis. If your test results are abnormal, your
doctor will suggest appropriate follow-up tests or may refer you to a specialist.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How frequently should I get this test done?</h2>
<p>
If you have been diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis, your doctor will determine the frequency of this
test based on the progression of your condition and your response to the treatment.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can this test be done at home?</h2>
<p>
No, the Autoimmune Hepatitis Panel II requires a blood sample to be taken by a healthcare professional.
The analysis should be performed in a laboratory.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can this test diagnose other liver diseases?</h2>
<p>
While the Autoimmune Hepatitis Panel II is primarily designed to help diagnose autoimmune hepatitis,
abnormal results can suggest other liver diseases.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Which doctor should I consult if my test values are abnormal?</h2>
<p>
If your test values are abnormal, you should consult a hepatologist or gastroenterologist for further
evaluation and treatment.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the normal values for the tests in the panel?</h2>
<p>
The normal values for the tests in the panel are generally negative. The presence of antibodies suggests
the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis or related conditions.</p>
<p>Understanding the nuances of autoimmune hepatitis can make the process of diagnosis and
management less overwhelming. This complex condition requires a comprehensive approach for
accurate diagnosis, and the Autoimmune Hepatitis Panel II serves as a powerful tool in this endeavor.
Timely diagnosis and treatment can prevent severe liver damage, making it crucial to consult your
doctor if you suspect any symptoms or abnormalities. Stay proactive and informed to ensure optimal
liver health.</p>
