<h1 class="test-h1">CLL Extended 2: FCM CLL Panel and Karyotyping and FISH For 17p and ATM Del </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells, leading to their abnormal proliferation. CLL Extended 2 is an in-depth diagnostic test that combines Flow Cytometry (FCM), Karyotyping, and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) to analyze the cells affected by CLL. Flow Cytometry studies the properties of cells, Karyotyping examines chromosomes, and FISH detects specific DNA sequences, including the 17p deletion and ATM deletion (11q). These analyses help in understanding the genetic characteristics of the leukemia cells, which is essential in evaluating the prognosis and making informed treatment decisions. <br><br>
The 17p deletion and ATM deletion are especially significant because they are associated with aggressive forms of CLL. Identifying these deletions enables doctors to establish a more personalized treatment plan for patients.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is CLL Extended 2 test? </h2>
	<p>CLL Extended 2 test combines Flow Cytometry for cell characterization, Karyotyping for chromosome analysis, and FISH for detecting specific DNA sequences, including the 17p deletion and ATM deletion, which are significant in CLL prognosis and treatment. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the significance of 17p deletion and ATM deletion in CLL? </h2>
	<p>The 17p deletion and ATM deletion are chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with an aggressive course of CLL and a poor response to standard chemotherapy. Detecting these deletions helps in making more informed treatment decisions. </p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why should I get the CLL Extended 2 test? </h2>
	<p>If you have been diagnosed with CLL, this test provides essential information about the genetic makeup of the leukemia cells. This information can influence prognosis, treatment options, and management strategies. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Do I need to prepare in any way for this test? </h2>
	<p>No specific preparation is required. However, it's important to inform your doctor of any medications or supplements you are taking as they may interfere with the test results. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What kind of information does this test provide? </h2>
	<p>This test provides detailed information about the properties and genetic characteristics of the CLL cells, including chromosomal abnormalities like the 17p deletion and ATM deletion. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How will this test affect my treatment options? </h2>
	<p>The detection of chromosomal abnormalities, especially 17p and ATM deletions, may suggest that the disease could be more aggressive or resistant to certain treatments. This information helps doctors in devising an effective treatment plan. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are normal values for this test? </h2>
	<p>In a normal sample, the 17p and ATM deletions should not be present. Their presence in CLL cells is indicative of chromosomal abnormalities. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What kind of doctor should I see if my results are abnormal? </h2>
	<p>If the results of this test are abnormal, it is important to consult a hematologist or an oncologist who specializes in the treatment of blood cancers. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the levels detected in this test? </h2>
	<p>The levels detected in this test can be affected by the progression of CLL, previous treatments, and the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Is there any way to prevent or reduce chromosomal abnormalities in CLL?</h2>
	<p> Chromosomal abnormalities in CLL are not preventable as they are genetic in nature. However, early detection and appropriate management can sometimes slow the progression of the disease.</p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can CLL be cured? </h2>
	<p>As of now, CLL is usually not curable, but it can often be managed effectively for many years with the appropriate treatment. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What new treatments are available for CLL, especially with 17p and ATM deletions? </h2>
	<p>Newer targeted therapies such as ibrutinib and venetoclax are showing promising results in treating CLL patients with 17p and ATM deletions. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done? </h2>
	<p>The frequency of this test should be determined by your doctor, based on the progression of the disease and the treatment plan. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test predict how my CLL will progress? </h2>
	<p>While this test can provide information on the genetic makeup of the CLL cells, which is useful for prognosis, it cannot predict with certainty how the disease will progress in every individual. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is it possible for the 17p and ATM deletions to develop over time? </h2>
	<p>Yes, it is possible for these deletions to develop as the disease progresses, which is why repeated testing may sometimes be necessary. </p>

	<p> Understanding the genetic composition of CLL cells is critical for managing the disease effectively. The CLL Extended 2 test, which analyzes cell properties through Flow Cytometry and detects chromosomal abnormalities through Karyotyping and FISH, provides essential information that can help your doctor devise a more personalized and effective treatment plan. Especially with chromosomal abnormalities like 17p and ATM deletions, knowing what you're up against can lead to better outcomes through targeted therapies. Regular monitoring and strict adherence to your doctor's recommendations are crucial in managing CLL.</p>
