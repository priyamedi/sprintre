								<p><strong>The <strong>AFB/TB Susceptibility: Levofloxacin (Rapid- MGIT)</strong> test plays a significant role in the diagnostic toolkit for Tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This test identifies whether the bacteria are susceptible or resistant to Levofloxacin, a key antibiotic used in the management of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). The information gleaned from this test allows healthcare professionals to tailor effective treatment regimens.</p>
								<p>This susceptibility test employs the MGIT (Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube) methodology to promptly discern if M. tuberculosis in a patient's sample is resistant to Levofloxacin. Rapid and accurate identification of drug resistance is paramount for the initiation of suitable treatment, curtailing the spread of the disease, and mitigating the development of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB).</p>
								<p>Given the rise in MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases worldwide, the importance of identifying the susceptibility of the TB bacteria to first-line and second-line anti-TB drugs cannot be overstated. Understanding the resistance profile of the bacterium is crucial to the successful treatment and control of TB.</p>
