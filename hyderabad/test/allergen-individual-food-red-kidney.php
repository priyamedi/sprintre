<div class="post-text">
<p>Red kidney beans are a popular ingredient in many cuisines. They are often used in dishes such as chili, salads, and curries. They are known for their high nutritional value including protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. However, in some individuals, consuming red kidney beans can cause an allergic reaction. This reaction occurs when the immune system identifies proteins in the beans as harmful substances and mounts an inappropriate response.</p>
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Red Kidney Bean test is designed to identify if an individual has an allergy to red kidney beans. The test measures the presence of specific antibodies, called Immunoglobulin E (IgE), which are produced in response to the proteins present in red kidney beans.
