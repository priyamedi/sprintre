<h1 class="test-h1">Bordetella Pertussis by PCR


 </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>Bordetella Pertussis is a bacterium that is responsible for causing whooping cough or pertussis, which is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection. The PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test for Bordetella Pertussis is a diagnostic test that is used to detect the presence of the bacterium’s DNA in a patient’s respiratory secretions. This is a highly sensitive and specific test, which makes it extremely effective in diagnosing whooping cough, even in cases where bacterial culture might not be as reliable.
 </p>
<p>Whooping cough is characterized by severe coughing spells and a ‘whooping’ sound made when breathing in after coughing. It is particularly dangerous for infants and young children, but can also affect adolescents and adults. Vaccination is the primary preventive measure, but even vaccinated individuals can sometimes contract the disease, although typically in a milder form.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the Bordetella Pertussis PCR test used for?
 </h2>
	<p>This test is used to detect the presence of Bordetella Pertussis bacteria in the respiratory secretions. It's primarily used to diagnose whooping cough.
 </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the Bordetella Pertussis PCR test performed? </h2>
	<p>A healthcare professional will take a nasopharyngeal swab, which involves inserting a special swab into the nose to the back of the throat to collect a sample. This sample is then analyzed in the laboratory using PCR to detect Bordetella Pertussis DNA.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is PCR different from other tests for Bordetella Pertussis?</h2>
<p>PCR is more sensitive and faster than culture methods. It can detect the bacteria even in small quantities and provide results within hours, whereas culture can take days.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test be used if I have been vaccinated against whooping cough?</h2>
<p>Yes, the test can still be used if you have been vaccinated. It is important to note that vaccination reduces the risk of infection but does not eliminate it completely.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does a positive result mean?</h2>
<p>A positive result indicates that Bordetella Pertussis DNA was detected in the sample, suggesting a current infection with the bacterium.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What treatment options are available for whooping cough?</h2>
<p>Antibiotics are typically used to treat whooping cough. It is important to start the antibiotics early in the infection to reduce the severity and duration of the symptoms.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What can I do to prevent spreading the infection to others?</h2>
<p>If you are diagnosed with whooping cough, it’s important to stay home, avoid close contact with others, especially infants and elderly, and cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can adults get whooping cough?</h2>
<p>Yes, adults can get whooping cough, even if they were vaccinated as children. The immunity from the vaccine or from a previous infection can wane over time.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there complications associated with whooping cough?</h2>
<p>Yes, complications can include pneumonia, difficulty breathing, dehydration, and in severe cases, brain damage or death, especially in infants.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can I protect my child from whooping cough?</h2>
<p>Ensure your child is vaccinated according to the recommended schedule. Also, make sure that adolescents and adults who are in close contact with your child are up-to-date with their whooping cough vaccinations.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How reliable is the Bordetella Pertussis PCR test?</h2>
<p>PCR is highly sensitive and specific, making it one of the most reliable tests for detecting Bordetella Pertussis.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How soon after exposure should I get tested?</h2>
<p>It’s advisable to get tested as soon as you experience symptoms of whooping cough, especially if you have been in contact with someone who has been diagnosed with the disease.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is there a possibility of a false-positive result?</h2>
<p>While PCR is highly accurate, no test is foolproof. Sometimes contamination or technical errors can lead to a false-positive result. Discuss any concerns with your doctor.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any precautions to take before the test?</h2>
<p>There are no specific precautions. However, it’s best to follow any instructions provided by the healthcare professional.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult if my results are positive?</h2>
<p>If your results are positive for Bordetella Pertussis, you should consult your doctor who may refer you to an infectious disease specialist if needed.</p>

<p>The Bordetella Pertussis PCR test is an essential tool in the early detection and treatment of whooping cough. Since the infection is highly contagious and can have severe complications, particularly in infants, timely diagnosis is crucial. If you or your child are exhibiting symptoms of whooping cough, or have been in contact with someone who has, consult your doctor about the Bordetella Pertussis PCR test.</p>
