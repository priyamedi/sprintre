<h1 class="test-h1">KRAS Gene Analysis (Codons 12, 13, 61, 146) </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>The KRAS gene plays a critical role in controlling cell division and growth. Mutations
in this gene can lead to uncontrolled cell division, which may result in the
development of tumors. KRAS Gene Analysis focusing on Codons 12, 13, 61, and 146
is a diagnostic procedure that detects mutations in specific regions of the KRAS gene,
helping in the diagnosis and management of various cancers, particularly colorectal
and lung cancers. </p>
<p>Codons 12, 13, 61, and 146 are regions of the KRAS gene where mutations are
commonly found in tumors. Identifying these mutations is crucial for making
treatment decisions, as they can affect how a tumor responds to certain
medications. This analysis can guide healthcare professionals in choosing the most
effective treatment strategy for patients with cancer. </p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is KRAS Gene Analysis important?</h2>
	<p>KRAS Gene Analysis is important for identifying mutations that are associated with
various cancers. The presence of mutations can guide treatment decisions, as some
tumors with KRAS mutations do not respond to certain therapies.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required for this test?</h2>
<p>No, fasting is not required for KRAS Gene Analysis.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the sample for the test collected?</h2>
<p>A blood sample is taken through a needle from the arm, or a tissue sample may be
obtained from a tumor through a biopsy procedure.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What information does this test provide?</h2>
<p>The test identifies mutations in codons 12, 13, 61, and 146 of the KRAS gene. These
mutations are common in various cancers and can influence treatment options and
prognosis.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can the results of this test help in the treatment of cancer?</h2>
<p>If a KRAS mutation is identified, it can indicate that the tumor may not respond to
certain targeted therapies, and alternative treatment options should be considered.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done?</h2>
<p>KRAS Gene Analysis is usually performed once, at the time of cancer diagnosis or
before starting therapy, to inform treatment decisions.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are normal values for this test?</h2>
<p>Normal results would indicate no mutations in the analyzed codons of the KRAS
gene. The presence of mutations would be considered abnormal.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What precautions should be taken after the test?</h2>
<p>There are no specific precautions. However, patients should follow the doctor's
instructions and be prepared to discuss treatment options based on the results.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What factors can affect the levels of KRAS mutations?</h2>
<p>KRAS mutations are genetic changes and are not influenced by lifestyle or
environmental factors.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should be consulted in case of abnormal value?</h2>
<p>In case of abnormal results, an oncologist should be consulted for proper diagnosis
and treatment planning.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the significance of analyzing codons 12, 13, 61, and 146 specifically?</h2>
<p>Codons 12, 13, 61, and 146 are regions in the KRAS gene where mutations are
commonly found in cancers. These mutations are known to impact the protein
function and influence how the cancer responds to treatment.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can KRAS Gene Analysis predict the likelihood of developing cancer?</h2>
<p>This analysis is not used as a predictive test for the likelihood of developing cancer; it
is used to inform treatment decisions for patients who have already been diagnosed
with cancer.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What types of cancer are most associated with KRAS mutations?</h2>
<p>KRAS mutations are most commonly associated with colorectal cancer, lung cancer,
and pancreatic cancer.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Are there other genes that should be tested along with KRAS for better
understanding?</h2>
<p>Yes, often the NRAS and BRAF genes are also tested along with KRAS as mutations in
these genes can also have implications on treatment decisions.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can changes in lifestyle or diet affect KRAS mutations?</h2>
<p>No, KRAS mutations are genetic changes within the cells and are not affected by
lifestyle or dietary changes.</p>

<p>Determining the genetic characteristics of a tumor is critical in cancer management.
KRAS Gene Analysis, particularly at codons 12, 13, 61, and 146, provides invaluable
information regarding the genetic makeup of the tumor. This information is pivotal
in making informed decisions on treatment strategies. Consulting an oncologist with
the results of this analysis is essential to understand and discuss the most effective
treatment options available based on the tumor’s genetic profile.</p>
