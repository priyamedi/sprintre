<div class="post-text">
<p>Lung cancer, specifically non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), can often involve various genetic changes that contribute to its development and progression. Recognizing these alterations is crucial as it assists in determining the most effective therapeutic strategy, particularly as some treatments target specific mutations. The Lung Cancer Panel 2 utilizes Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) to detect rearrangements in ALK, ROS1, RET genes, and MET gene amplification. These genetic alterations, though less common, are associated with specific subtypes of NSCLC and are targetable by certain treatments. </p>
<p>The FISH technique uses fluorescent probes to visualize the rearrangement or amplification of specific regions on the chromosomes where these genes are located. A positive result can lead to more targeted treatment options for the patient and provide valuable prognostic information.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is this test important? 
 </h2>
	<p>This test is crucial because it can identify specific genetic changes that could be contributing to the development and growth of your cancer. These changes can affect how the cancer responds to certain treatments, so knowing about them can help your doctor develop a more personalized treatment plan. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the sample for this test collected? 
 </h2>
	<p>A tissue sample is generally obtained through a biopsy procedure, where a small piece of the tumor is removed for testing. The method used to obtain the sample depends on the size and location of the tumor. </p>

	<!--//section achieved-->
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I eat and drink before the test? </h2>
<p>Yes, there are no dietary restrictions associated with this test. However, if the biopsy procedure requires anesthesia, you may need to fast prior to the procedure. Your healthcare provider will provide specific instructions based on your individual situation.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with this test? </h2>
<p>The risks associated with this test are primarily related to the biopsy procedure used to collect the tissue sample. These can include infection, bleeding, or complications from anesthesia. The test itself does not pose any risks.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long does it take to get the results?</h2> 
<p>The turnaround time for the Lung Cancer Panel 2 is usually between 1 to 2 weeks. This can vary depending on the laboratory that is processing the sample.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do my test results mean?</h2> 
<p>If your test results show a gene rearrangement or amplification, it may mean that you could benefit from certain targeted therapies that are designed to inhibit the activity of the affected genes. Your doctor will discuss the results with you and explain what they mean for your treatment options.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test be used to monitor the progress of my treatment? </h2>
<p>No, this test is not typically used to monitor treatment progress. It's mainly used to help guide initial treatment decisions. Other tests, such as imaging studies or blood tests, may be used to monitor how well your treatment is working.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What happens if no gene rearrangements or amplifications are found? </h2>
<p>If no gene rearrangements or amplifications are found, it means that none of the genetic changes tested for in this panel are present in your cancer cells. This doesn't mean your cancer is untreatable — it simply means that other treatment approaches might be more effective.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the limitations of this test? </h2>
<p>Although this test can detect rearrangements and amplifications in the ALK, ROS1, RET, and MET genes, it does not identify all possible genetic changes that might be involved in your cancer. Further, this test is typically only useful for people with non-small cell lung cancer, as these genetic changes are not common in other types of cancer.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are these test results always accurate? </h2>
<p>While the FISH technique used in this test is highly sensitive and specific, there is always a small chance of false positive or false negative results. It's also important to note that a negative result does not exclude the possibility of other genetic alterations not assessed in this panel.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is this test covered by my insurance? </h2>
<p>Coverage for this test can vary by insurance provider and policy. It's recommended to check with your insurance company for specific information regarding coverage.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I request this test on my own?</h2> 
<p>This test is typically ordered by a healthcare provider who is managing your care. It's always recommended to discuss any concerns or questions you have with them.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the results of this test predict my prognosis? </h2>
<p>While the results can provide some prognostic information, many other factors, such as the stage and grade of the cancer, your overall health, and how well the cancer responds to treatment, also play a significant role in your prognosis.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I take this test if I have already started treatment for lung cancer? </h2>
<p>Yes, this test can be performed at any time during your treatment, as the results may help refine your treatment plan.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How reliable is this test? </h2>
<p>The reliability of this test is high, but it's important to remember that no test is 100% accurate. Any concerns about the results should be discussed with your healthcare provider.</p>
