							<p>C1 Esterase Inhibitor, often abbreviated as C1-INH, is a protein found in the blood that
								plays a critical role in regulating the activation of certain components of the immune
								system. The functional C1 Esterase Inhibitor test is designed to assess the functional
								activity of this protein. This is important because certain disorders can result from
								the deficiency or malfunction of C1 Esterase Inhibitor, such as hereditary angioedema
								(HAE), which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by episodes of severe swelling in
								different parts of the body. </p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is C1 Esterase Inhibitor?</h2>
								<p>C1 Esterase Inhibitor is a protein in the blood that helps control inflammation and
									acts as a regulator of the complement and contact systems, both part of the immune
									response.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the C1 Esterase Inhibitor - Functional test important?
								</h2>
								<p>This test is important for diagnosing conditions such as hereditary angioedema, where
									a deficiency or dysfunction of C1 Esterase Inhibitor can cause severe, recurrent
									swelling episodes. The test helps determine if the protein is present and
									functioning properly.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)?</h2>
								<p>Hereditary Angioedema is a rare genetic disorder characterized by episodes of severe
									swelling, often affecting the face, extremities, airways, and intestinal tract. It
									is caused by a deficiency or malfunction of the C1 Esterase Inhibitor protein.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does it mean if C1 Esterase Inhibitor is low or not
									functioning properly?</h2>
								<p>Low or non-functional C1 Esterase Inhibitor can lead to excessive activation of the
									complement system, resulting in recurrent episodes of angioedema, which is marked by
									severe swelling in different parts of the body.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the C1 Esterase Inhibitor - Functional test performed?
								</h2>
								<p>The test is performed using a blood sample. A healthcare professional will draw blood
									from a vein, usually in your arm, and the sample will be sent to a laboratory for
									analysis.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can I prepare for this test?</h2>
								<p>No special preparation is needed for the C1 Esterase Inhibitor - Functional test.
									However, you should inform your doctor of any medications or supplements you are
									taking, as some can affect the test results.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for C1 Esterase Inhibitor -
									Functional?</h2>
								<p>Normal values can vary among different laboratories, but generally, the functional
									activity of C1 Esterase Inhibitor is expected to be within the range of 70-130% of
									normal.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can C1 Esterase Inhibitor deficiency be treated?</h2>
								<p>Yes, treatment options for conditions caused by C1 Esterase Inhibitor deficiency,
									such as hereditary angioedema, include medications that replace the missing or
									non-functional protein, and medications that reduce swelling.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult if my C1 Esterase Inhibitor
									levels are abnormal?</h2>
								<p>You should consult an immunologist or allergist if your C1 Esterase Inhibitor levels
									are abnormal as these specialists have experience in managing disorders related to
									the immune system.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Is Hereditary Angioedema the only condition related to C1
									Esterase Inhibitor?</h2>
								<p>No, while Hereditary Angioedema is the most common condition associated with C1
									Esterase Inhibitor deficiency, there are other conditions and factors which may also
									be associated with abnormalities of this protein.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can C1 Esterase Inhibitor deficiency be inherited?</h2>
								<p>Yes, Hereditary Angioedema is an inherited disorder, usually passed down from one
									generation to the next.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can the functional activity of C1 Esterase Inhibitor change
									over time?</h2>
								<p>Yes, the functional activity of C1 Esterase Inhibitor can vary, and in some
									individuals with hereditary angioedema, it may change over time.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the complement system?</h2>
								<p>The complement system is a part of the immune system that enhances the ability of
									antibodies and phagocytes to clear microbes and damaged cells, promote inflammation,
									and attack the pathogen's cell membrane.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can lifestyle changes impact C1 Esterase Inhibitor levels?
								</h2>
								<p>There is no direct evidence to suggest that lifestyle changes can significantly
									impact C1 Esterase Inhibitor levels. However, a healthy lifestyle can contribute to
									overall immune system health.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Are there any risks associated with this test?</h2>
								<p>The risks associated with the C1 Esterase Inhibitor - Functional test are minimal and
									similar to those of a standard blood draw, including bruising, infection, or slight
									pain at the site of the needle insertion.</p>
								<p>Understanding the function of C1 Esterase Inhibitor is critical in the diagnosis and
								management of hereditary angioedema and other related conditions. This test is a
								valuable tool for both patients and doctors in evaluating the activity of this important
								protein and managing conditions that arise due to its deficiency or dysfunction.</p>
