<div class="post-text">
<p>The macroprolactin test is a diagnostic blood test that measures the levels of a specific form of prolactin, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, known as macroprolactin. Macroprolactin is a large form of prolactin that is not bioactive. However, it can interfere with regular prolactin function and lead to hyperprolactinemia, a condition characterized by higher-than-normal levels of prolactin in the blood.
 </p>
<p>Prolactin plays a key role in a variety of bodily functions, particularly those related to reproduction. In women, it aids in the production of breast milk after childbirth, while in men, its functions are less well understood but it's thought to play a role in the production of sperm. While it's normal for prolactin levels to fluctuate during the day and in response to physical stimuli, persistently high levels of prolactin – especially macroprolactin – can lead to symptoms such as menstrual irregularities, infertility, and production of breast milk in individuals not pregnant or nursing (galactorrhea). </p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What kind of doctor orders a macroprolactin test? </h2>

<p>The risks associated with the macroprolactin test are minimal and are similar to those of any routine blood draw. These may include minor pain or bruising at the site where blood is drawn.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can stress affect the macroprolactin test results? </h2>
<p>Yes, stress can cause temporary increases in prolactin levels. It's advisable to have the test done when you're not under severe stress to get accurate results.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How can I lower my macroprolactin levels?</h2>
<p> The treatment for high macroprolactin levels will depend on the underlying cause. If a certain medication is causing high levels, it may need to be adjusted or changed. If a pituitary tumor is the cause, treatment may involve medication, radiation therapy, or surgery.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Is the macroprolactin test covered by insurance?</h2>
