							<p>The Food Fruit Allergy Panel is a comprehensive test designed to detect potential food
								allergies related to various fruits. These include mango, kiwi, banana, papaya, apple,
								peach, pear, and pineapple. By measuring the levels of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
								antibodies in your blood, this test can help identify whether you're allergic to any of
								these fruits. </p>
							<p>Food allergies occur when your immune system overreacts to certain foods that are usually
								harmless. The symptoms can range from mild, such as itching and hives, to severe, such
								as difficulty breathing and anaphylaxis. Identifying the specific foods that cause these
								allergic reactions is crucial in managing your symptoms and avoiding potentially
								life-threatening situations. </p>

									allergic to certain fruits by measuring specific IgE antibodies in your blood. A
									high level of these antibodies indicates an allergic reaction.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Do I need to fast before this test?</h2>
								<p>No, you do not need to fast before this test. You can continue with your regular
									diet.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does this test measure?</h2>
								<p>This test measures the level of specific IgE antibodies in your blood that respond to
									certain fruits. If your body produces these antibodies, it means you're likely
									allergic to the corresponding fruit.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I get tested?</h2>
								<p>The frequency of testing depends on your symptoms and the doctor's advice. If you're
									experiencing allergic reactions and your doctor suspects a food allergy, they might
									recommend this test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
								<p>Normal values can vary between laboratories. Generally, a low level or absence of
									specific IgE antibodies against the tested fruits indicates no allergy.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do abnormal test results mean?</h2>
								<p>Abnormal test results suggest an allergy to one or more of the tested fruits. Higher
									levels of specific IgE antibodies indicate that your body is reacting to these
									fruits.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can anything affect the results of this test?</h2>
								<p>Yes, certain factors can affect the results of this test. These include your exposure
									to the fruits before the test, any medicines you're taking, and your overall health
									condition. Always inform your doctor about your medical history and current health
									status.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should I take before this test?</h2>
								<p>No specific precautions are required for this test. However, always inform your
									doctor about any medicines or supplements you're taking.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the modifiable factors that can affect the results of
									this test?</h2>
								<p>The main modifiable factor that can affect the results of this test is your diet.
									Consuming the tested fruits before the test can cause your body to produce specific
									IgE antibodies, which might affect the test results.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the non-modifiable factors that can affect the test
									results?</h2>
								<p>Non-modifiable factors include your genetic predisposition to allergies. If your
									family has a history of food allergies, you might be more likely to develop them.
								</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Which doctor should I consult if my test results are abnormal?
								</h2>
								<p>If your test results are abnormal, you should consult an allergist or immunologist.
									They can provide a comprehensive evaluation and suggest an appropriate treatment
									plan.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the symptoms of food allergies?</h2>
								<p>Symptoms of food allergies can range from mild reactions, such as itching, hives, and
									swelling, to more severe reactions, such as difficulty breathing and anaphylaxis.
								</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can I take this test at home?</h2>
								<p>No, this test requires a blood sample, which must be drawn by a healthcare
									professional in a clinical setting.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How is this test performed?</h2>
								<p>This test is performed using a blood sample. A healthcare professional will draw
									blood from a vein, usually in your arm.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can this test be performed on children?</h2>
								<p>Yes, this test can be performed on individuals of any age, including children.
									However, always consult a doctor for advice.</p>
								<p>Understanding your body's reactions to specific foods can help you manage your food
									allergies effectively. The Food Fruit Allergy Panel is a comprehensive test that can
									provide crucial insights in this regard. Share your test results with your doctor,
									who can guide you in understanding your allergies and devising a suitable management
									plan. Regular monitoring and careful management of your diet can significantly
									improve your quality of life.</p>
