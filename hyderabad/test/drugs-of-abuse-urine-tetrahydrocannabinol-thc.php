<p>Tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as THC, is the primary psychoactive component found in
cannabis. This means that it's the substance that causes the “high” associated with marijuana use.
Cannabis products, including marijuana, have been used for centuries for both recreational and
medicinal purposes. Today, they are still used in some areas for pain relief, appetite stimulation, and
various other medical reasons. However, cannabis is also commonly used recreationally and can be
abused. </p>
<p>The Drugs Of Abuse - Urine: Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) test is a urine test used to detect the presence
of THC in the body. This is commonly done for workplace drug testing, in legal settings, or in clinical
settings when cannabis use is suspected. </p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test differentiate between CBD and THC? </h2>
	<p> Most standard urine tests are designed to detect THC, not CBD. However, some CBD products may

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the legal status of THC?</h2>
	<p>The legal status of THC varies by country and state. In some places, it is illegal, while in others, it is legal
for medical and/or recreational use. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the risks of using THC? </h2>
	<p>Risks include impaired coordination (increasing accident risk), anxiety, paranoia, cognitive impairments,
and developing a cannabis use disorder. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is THC metabolized in the body? </h2>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What steps can be taken if someone is struggling with cannabis use disorder? </h2>
	<p>It is important to encourage them to seek medical assistance. Your doctor can provide guidance and

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What should I do if I have used THC and need to take a drug test? </h2>
	<p>Being honest with the testing authority or your healthcare provider is important. Depending on the
circumstances, it might be appropriate to disclose any recent THC use before taking the test. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any foods or medications that can affect the test results? </h2>
	<p>While uncommon, certain foods and medications may cause a false positive. It's important to disclose all
medications and supplements to the lab or your doctor. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Which doctor should I consult if my test result is positive?</h2>
	<p> If your test result is positive and you are concerned about your cannabis use or its health implications, it
is important to consult your primary care doctor.</p>
