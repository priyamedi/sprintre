<div class="post-text">
<p>The <strong>Aldehyde Chopra Test</strong>, also known as the Chopra test or the Urinary Aldehyde Test, is a diagnostic test performed to detect the presence and concentration of aldehydes in the urine. This test is often used to assess liver health, as aldehyde concentrations can provide insights into the function of this organ.
 </p>
<p>Aldehydes are organic compounds that can be metabolized in the liver. Under normal conditions, the concentration of aldehydes in the urine should be minimal. However, elevated levels can indicate liver disease or damage, as this organ is responsible for the metabolism of aldehydes in the body.
