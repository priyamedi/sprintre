<div class="post-text">
<p>Growth hormone, also known as somatotropin, is a hormone that stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and cell regeneration in humans and other animals. It's a vital component in maintaining healthy human tissue, including that of the brain and other vital organs. It is synthesized, stored, and secreted by the somatotropic cells within the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland.</p>

<p>In children and adolescents, the hormone stimulates the growth of bone and cartilage, while in people of all ages, it helps to regulate the body's metabolism. This includes the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. It also plays a significant role in the body's physical development.</p>

<p>A Growth Hormone (GH) test measures the amount of growth hormone in the blood. This test is primarily used to identify growth hormone deficiency and to evaluate pituitary function. It's usually ordered when a child appears significantly shorter or taller than other children of the same age and gender, or when a child's growth rate slows and falls below the standard growth rate for their age group.</p>
