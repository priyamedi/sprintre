<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does this test measure?</h2>
<p>This test measures a range of metabolic markers, blood cell counts, thyroid hormones, urine components, and
    additionally, Leptin and Cortisol levels.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done?</h2>
<p>The frequency of this test should be decided by your healthcare provider based on your individual health status, risk
    factors, and ongoing treatment plans. In general, individuals with obesity or those at high risk may need to take
    this test annually.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
<p>Normal values can vary based on the lab and individual factors. Your healthcare provider or the laboratory staff will
    provide you with the specific reference ranges for each parameter.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should I take before this test?</h2>
<p>Avoid strenuous physical activity and consumption of alcohol or caffeinated beverages 24 hours before the test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the test results?</h2>
<p>Your diet, physical activity levels, medications, and any existing health conditions can impact the test results. It
    is essential to inform your healthcare provider of any medications you are taking and any health conditions you
    have.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult in case of abnormal test results?</h2>
<p>If your test results are abnormal, you should consult your primary care physician. Depending on the results, you may
    be referred to a specialist, such as an endocrinologist, cardiologist, or nephrologist.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can medications affect the results of this test?</h2>
<p>Yes, certain medications can affect the test results. It's important to inform your healthcare provider about all the
    medications you are currently taking.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Does physical activity affect the test results?</h2>
<p>Yes, strenuous physical activity prior to the test can potentially affect some test results. Therefore, it is
    recommended to avoid such activities 24 hours before the test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Does diet affect the test results?</h2>
<p>Yes, your diet can affect certain test parameters. For instance, a diet high in fats can impact your lipid levels,
    and a high-protein diet can influence uric acid and creatinine levels.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does an increased Leptin level indicate?</h2>
<p>High Leptin levels can indicate leptin resistance, a condition commonly seen in obesity where the body doesn't
    respond properly to leptin signals. This can result in increased food intake and reduced energy expenditure.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does an increased Cortisol level indicate?</h2>
<p>High cortisol levels may indicate Cushing's syndrome, chronic stress, depression, or certain tumors. However,
    elevated cortisol can also be a response to physical stress like illness, injury, or surgery.</p>
<p>Understanding your Obesity Capsule II diagnostic test results, in consultation with your
    healthcare provider, can guide you to necessary lifestyle changes or interventions for improved health and
    wellbeing. Remember, this test does not replace regular health checkups or consultations with your healthcare
    provider. Stay proactive about your health, ask questions, and make informed decisions.</p>
