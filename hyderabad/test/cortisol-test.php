<p>The Cortisol Test is a diagnostic tool that measures the levels of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, in the blood. Cortisol is often referred to as the “stress hormone” because it is released in response to stress and low blood-glucose concentration. Besides playing a critical role in how the body responds to stress, cortisol helps regulate blood pressure, metabolism, immune response, and inflammatory reactions.</p>

<p>Evaluating cortisol levels is crucial for diagnosing and managing disorders that affect cortisol production, such as Cushing’s syndrome, Addison’s disease, and adrenal insufficiency. Cushing’s syndrome occurs when the body produces too much cortisol, while Addison’s disease is characterized by inadequate cortisol production. The Cortisol Test helps physicians diagnose these conditions and tailor an appropriate treatment plan for patients.</p>

    affect cortisol levels.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are some non-modifiable factors that can affect cortisol levels?</h2>
<p>Genetic factors, such as inherited disorders like Cushing’s syndrome, and certain diseases affecting the adrenal
    or pituitary gland, are non-modifiable factors that can affect cortisol levels.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the Cortisol Test be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment for Cushing’s
    syndrome or Addison’s disease?</h2>
