<div class="post-text">
<p>Fertility Capsule IV is an inclusive blood test that examines four crucial hormones: Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Prolactin, and Testosterone. These hormones play key roles in reproductive health in both men and women. FSH and LH are important for ovulation in women and sperm production in men. Prolactin is essential for lactation in women, and Testosterone is an important sex hormone in men and plays a role in female reproductive health as well. </p>
<p>Understanding the levels of these hormones is important for individuals who are having difficulty conceiving or have other reproductive issues. By assessing these hormones, Fertility Capsule IV provides vital information to doctors that can help in diagnosing various conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), low sperm count, and hormonal imbalances affecting fertility. </p>
