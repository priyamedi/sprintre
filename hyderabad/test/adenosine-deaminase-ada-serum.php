								<p>Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme involved in purine metabolism. It is needed for the breakdown of adenosine from food and for the turnover of nucleic acids in tissues. The ADA test measures the amount of ADA in your blood serum, with high levels often indicating certain health conditions.</p>
								<p>Most commonly, ADA is tested to help diagnose or rule out tuberculosis (TB) or other mycobacterial infections. Increased ADA levels are also observed in some autoimmune diseases and specific types of leukemia. Therefore, understanding your ADA serum levels can provide vital insights into your overall health and help guide potential treatment strategies.</p>
