<h1 class="test-h1">Metabolic Screen Comprehensive - Urine </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>The Metabolic Screen Comprehensive test is a detailed examination performed on a urine sample to
screen for numerous metabolic disorders. It includes tests for Amino Acids-Qualitative, Reducing
Substances, DNPH Test, FeCl3 Test, Nitrosonaphthol, Nitroprusside, Silver Nitroprusside Tests. Metabolic
disorders occur when the body can't properly process food to convert it into energy. Many of these
disorders are genetic and can lead to a buildup of harmful substances in the body. Early detection
through tests like the Metabolic Screen Comprehensive can aid in early intervention, appropriate
treatment, and potentially preventing serious complications.
 </p>
<p>The wide array of tests in the Metabolic Screen Comprehensive examines different aspects of
metabolism, providing a thorough overview of metabolic functioning. Each test offers unique
information and contributes to a broader picture of an individual's metabolic health. </p>
