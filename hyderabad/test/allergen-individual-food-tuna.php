<h1 class="test-h1">Allergen, Individual - Food Tuna </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>Tuna, a saltwater fish, is enjoyed by people around the world for its rich flavor and texture. It's a nutritious source of high-quality protein, vitamins, and minerals, including vitamin D, vitamin B12, and omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients make it an excellent choice for a healthy diet. However, some individuals may have an allergy to tuna. The Allergen, Individual - Food Tuna test is a crucial tool to ascertain if a person is allergic to tuna. </p>
<p>This test evaluates the presence of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies that are specific to proteins found in tuna in the blood. When an individual's immune system mistakenly identifies the proteins in tuna as hazardous, it produces IgE antibodies. This allergic reaction can cause various symptoms, ranging from mild to severe. This test is essential for individuals who have experienced adverse reactions after consuming tuna, as it helps in identifying and confirming an allergy to tuna.
