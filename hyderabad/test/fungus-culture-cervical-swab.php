<div class="post-text">
<p>A fungus culture of a cervical swab is a laboratory test that checks for the presence of fungal organisms in the cervix. The cervix is the lower, narrow end of the uterus that forms a canal between the uterus and vagina. Various fungi, including species of Candida and others, can cause infections in this area leading to symptoms such as abnormal discharge, itching, and pain.</p>
<p>This test is performed by taking a swab of the cervical area and culturing it in a laboratory to allow any present fungi to grow. By identifying the specific type of fungus causing an infection, healthcare providers can prescribe the most appropriate antifungal medication. </p>
