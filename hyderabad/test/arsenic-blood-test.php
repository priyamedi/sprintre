<h1 class="test-h1">Arsenic - Blood Test </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>Arsenic is a naturally occurring element found in the environment, but in certain circumstances, it can also be a potent poison. It's found in various forms, as a natural component of the earth's crust, in pesticides, or as a by-product of certain industrial processes. While trace amounts are present in the environment, exposure to higher levels of arsenic can be hazardous to health. </p>
<p>Arsenic exposure can occur through different routes such as inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact. The primary source of exposure for most people is through drinking water that is contaminated with arsenic. Certain occupations such as mining, smelting, or manufacturing that involve working with arsenic compounds may also increase the risk of exposure.
 </p>
 <p>The Arsenic - Blood Test is conducted to determine the levels of arsenic in your blood, and it helps in evaluating whether you have been exposed to higher levels of arsenic than what is considered safe.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should you get this test done? </h2>
<p>This test should be done if there is a suspicion of arsenic poisoning, especially if an individual exhibits symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or has a known exposure to arsenic-contaminated water or works in an industry where arsenic is used.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done? </h2>
<p>The frequency of this test depends on the level and duration of exposure. Your doctor will guide you based on your specific situation.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal levels of arsenic in the blood?</h2>
<p>Normal levels of arsenic in the blood are usually less than 10 micrograms per liter (µg/L). However, normal ranges can vary slightly depending on the laboratory that analyzes the blood sample.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should be taken before the test?</h2>
<p>Before taking the test, avoid eating seafood for at least 48 hours as this can affect the results. Inform your doctor about any medications or supplements you are taking.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the levels of arsenic in the blood? </h2>
<p>Consumption of seafood, certain medications, exposure to industrial chemicals containing arsenic, and drinking water contaminated with arsenic can affect the levels.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the symptoms of arsenic poisoning?</h2>
<p>Symptoms of arsenic poisoning may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, darkening of the skin, and changes in red blood cells.</p>
