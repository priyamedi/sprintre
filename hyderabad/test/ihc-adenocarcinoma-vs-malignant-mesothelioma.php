<div class="post-text">
<p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) plays a pivotal role in distinguishing between different types of cancer. Among these, the distinction between adenocarcinoma and malignant mesothelioma is critical due to their similar presentation, but different treatment approaches and prognoses. The <strong>IHC - Adenocarcinoma Vs Malignant Mesothelioma test</strong>, which employs markers such as Ber-EP4, CEA, Calretinin, and WT-1, is instrumental in this process.
 </p>
<p>Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that begins in glandular cells, which secrete substances like mucus or other fluids, and is found in various parts of the body. Malignant mesothelioma, on the other hand, is a rare cancer that develops in the mesothelium, the thin tissue layer covering most of your internal organs.
 </p>
 <p>IHC is a lab test that uses antibodies to identify specific substances in the cells in a tissue sample. These substances may be associated with certain types of cancer. The markers Ber-EP4 and CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) are usually found in adenocarcinomas, while Calretinin and WT-1 (Wilms' tumor protein) are generally expressed in mesotheliomas.
</p>
<p>By identifying these markers, the <strong>IHC - Adenocarcinoma Vs Malignant Mesothelioma test</strong> allows doctors to differentiate between the two types of cancer, helping to guide treatment decisions.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is there any specific preparation required for this test?</h2>
<p>No specific preparation is required for this test. However, if the tissue sample will be collected through a surgical procedure or biopsy, your doctor will give you specific instructions regarding preparation for the procedure.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should I get this test done?</h2>
<p>Your doctor might recommend the IHC - Adenocarcinoma Vs Malignant Mesothelioma test if they suspect you have either adenocarcinoma or malignant mesothelioma based on your symptoms, medical history, and the results of other diagnostic tests. It's crucial to accurately diagnose your type of cancer to guide the most effective treatment plan.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does the IHC - Adenocarcinoma Vs Malignant Mesothelioma test measure?</h2>
<p>The <strong>IHC - Adenocarcinoma Vs Malignant Mesothelioma test</strong> measures the presence and amount of specific markers (Ber-EP4, CEA, Calretinin, and WT-1) in a tissue sample. Ber-EP4 and CEA are usually found in adenocarcinomas, while Calretinin and WT-1 are usually found in mesotheliomas. By identifying these markers, the test helps differentiate between adenocarcinoma and malignant mesothelioma.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done?</h2>
<p>The frequency of this test depends on your individual circumstances, including your <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms"><b style="color:#2C53A5">symptoms</b></a>, medical history, and the nature of any treatment you're receiving. If you're undergoing treatment for adenocarcinoma or malignant mesothelioma, your doctor may recommend this test at various points to monitor your response to treatment.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
<p>For the IHC - Adenocarcinoma Vs Malignant Mesothelioma test, there aren't typical "normal" values. The test identifies the presence or absence of specific markers. If the markers Ber-EP4 and CEA are detected, it suggests adenocarcinoma. If Calretinin and WT-1 are detected, it suggests malignant mesothelioma. However, the results should be interpreted in the context of your overall clinical picture.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should be taken before undergoing this test?</h2>
<p>There are no specific precautions to be taken for the IHC - Adenocarcinoma Vs Malignant Mesothelioma test itself. However, if you're having a biopsy or surgery to collect the tissue sample, your doctor will provide specific instructions regarding the preparation for that procedure.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which factors can affect the levels of the markers used in this test?</h2>
<p>The levels of the markers used in the IHC - Adenocarcinoma Vs Malignant Mesothelioma test can be affected by various factors, including the type, stage, and location of the cancer, as well as any treatments you might be receiving. Your doctor will take these factors into account when interpreting your test results.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult if my test results are abnormal?</h2>
<p>If your test results are abnormal, you should consult with a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, such as an oncologist or a pathologist. They will be able to interpret your results in the context of your overall health and medical history, and guide you in making the best decisions about your treatment.</p>

<p>The <strong>IHC - Adenocarcinoma Vs Malignant Mesothelioma test</strong> is a vital tool in the arsenal of diagnostic tests available to modern medicine. Accurately distinguishing between adenocarcinoma and malignant mesothelioma is essential for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. Armed with the knowledge about your disease and its diagnostic tests, you can make well-informed decisions about your health. Always remember, an open dialogue with your doctor is key to understanding your condition and treatment.</p>
