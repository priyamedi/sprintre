							<p><strong>Abnormal Haemoglobin Studies</strong>, specifically Hb Variant Blood test, plays a crucial role in the diagnostic process for various blood disorders and conditions. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen throughout the body. In people with hemoglobinopathies, the body produces abnormal hemoglobin. Variants of hemoglobin, such as Hemoglobin S, Hemoglobin C, and others, can lead to conditions like sickle cell anemia or thalassemia.
</p>
							<p>Understanding the type of hemoglobin variant you carry can significantly aid your doctor in diagnosing and managing a possible hemoglobin disorder. This test aids in detecting abnormal forms of hemoglobin and determining their quantities, assisting in the diagnosis of several inherited disorders, which can be asymptomatic or manifest as varying degrees of anemia, chronic hemolysis, or a heightened susceptibility to infections.
