								<p>Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a vital nutrient required for proper red blood cell formation, neurological function, and DNA synthesis. It is mainly found in animal products, including fish, meat, poultry, eggs, and milk products. The Vitamin B12 test measures the amount of vitamin B12 in your blood and helps to diagnose deficiencies or excesses that may lead to various health problems.</p>
								<p>A deficiency in Vitamin B12 can lead to various symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, anemia, constipation, loss of appetite, weight loss, and neurological changes. In contrast, an excess of vitamin B12 can occur due to diseases such as liver disease, certain types of leukemia, or due to the overconsumption of vitamin supplements.</p>
