								<p>The Allergen, Individual - Animal Dog Dander Diagnostic Test is a key investigation for diagnosing an allergic response to dog dander. This test measures the levels of specific antibodies in your blood produced as an immune response to exposure to dog dander. It is particularly useful for individuals who own dogs, work with dogs, or are regularly exposed to environments with dogs.</p>
								<p>Allergies occur when your immune system overreacts to typically harmless substances, like dog dander. The body's immune response leads to the production of antibodies against these substances, causing a series of reactions that result in symptoms ranging from mild, like sneezing and itchy eyes, to severe ones that could be life-threatening.</p>
