<div class="post-text">
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Weed Pollen Mugwort test is a specialized examination that determines an individual's sensitivity to Mugwort pollen. Mugwort, or Artemisia, is a group of flowering plants known for their high pollen production, which frequently induces allergic reactions. An allergy is an overreaction of the immune system to a usually harmless substance, in this case, Mugwort pollen. This substance is known as an allergen. </p>
<p>An allergic reaction to Mugwort pollen may manifest in various ways, from common symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes, to severe reactions like difficulty breathing or anaphylaxis in highly sensitive individuals. Understanding your allergens can help manage your symptoms effectively and improve your quality of life. </p>
