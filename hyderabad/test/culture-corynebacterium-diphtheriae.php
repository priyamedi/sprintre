<p>Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a bacterium responsible for causing diphtheria, an infection that affects
the mucous membranes of the nose and throat. Diphtheria can be a serious illness, leading to difficulty
breathing, heart failure, paralysis, and even death. Early detection and appropriate treatment are vital in
managing this infection. </p>
<p>Culture for Corynebacterium diphtheriae involves taking a swab from the throat, nose, or wound and
analyzing it in the laboratory to identify the presence of the bacteria. The test is critical in diagnosing
diphtheria, particularly in individuals who have not been vaccinated or who have come into contact with
an infected person. </p>
