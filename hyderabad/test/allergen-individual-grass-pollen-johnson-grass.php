<div class="post-text">
<p> Johnson Grass, scientifically known as Sorghum halepense, is a perennial grass that is found in various
regions across the globe. Although it is primarily known as an invasive weed, Johnson Grass is also used
for forage and to prevent erosion. However, when Johnson Grass flowers, it releases pollen into the air,
which can be an allergen for certain individuals. This test is designed to identify whether a person has an
allergy to Johnson Grass pollen by detecting specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood that
react to this pollen.</p>
