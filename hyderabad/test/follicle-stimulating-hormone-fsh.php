<div class="post-text">
<p>Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is a type of gonadotropin hormone that is vital for puberty and fertility in both men and women. It is released by the pituitary gland in the brain. In women, FSH stimulates the ovaries to develop follicles, each containing an egg. In men, FSH is responsible for sperm production.
 </p>
<p>An FSH test is a simple blood test that measures the level of FSH in your blood. This test is often used to evaluate fertility issues, assess menstrual problems, or diagnose disorders of the pituitary gland or other diseases related to the reproductive process.
