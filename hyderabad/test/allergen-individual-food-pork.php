<div class="post-text">
<p>Pork, the meat of the pig, is one of the most commonly consumed meats worldwide. It can be cooked in various ways, including roasting, grilling, or frying. For many, pork is a regular part of the diet and is enjoyed for its taste and versatility. However, for some individuals, consuming pork can cause an allergic reaction. Pork allergy is a hypersensitive reaction of the immune system to the proteins found in pork. Though not extremely common, it is essential to recognize and manage this allergy appropriately to avoid adverse health effects.</p>
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Pork test is a diagnostic tool used to identify if an individual has an allergy to pork. It measures the level of specific antibodies, known as Immunoglobulin E (IgE), produced in response to proteins in pork.
