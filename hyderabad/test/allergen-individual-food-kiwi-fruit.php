							<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Kiwi Fruit test is a specific kind of blood test that
								determines whether an individual is allergic to kiwi fruit. Kiwi allergies are
								relatively common and can be serious, especially for individuals who also have allergies
								to latex or other fruits.
							</p>
							<p>
								This test detects the presence of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies that are specific to
								kiwi fruit in the bloodstream. IgE antibodies are produced by the immune system when it
								encounters what it perceives to be a harmful substance. In the case of a kiwi allergy,
								the immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in the kiwi as dangerous, resulting in
								an allergic reaction.
