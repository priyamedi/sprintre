<div class="post-text">
<p>Black pepper is a common spice used worldwide, renowned for its strong flavor. However, some people may be allergic to black pepper. Allergic reactions occur when the body's immune system mistakenly identifies a harmless substance, such as the compounds in black pepper, as a threat and reacts against it.</p>

<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Black Pepper test is designed to check for an allergy to black pepper. This test detects the presence of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against black pepper in the blood. Elevated levels of these antibodies indicate that an allergic reaction is likely if the person consumes black pepper.</p>
