							<p>The Allergy Panel - Food Non-Vegetarian Panel is a diagnostic test performed to identify
								specific food allergies. The test measures your body's immune response to various
								non-vegetarian foods, including chicken meat, beef, salmon, tuna, shrimp, pork, codfish,
								egg yolk, blue mussel, and egg white </p>
							<p>Food allergies occur when your immune system reacts to specific proteins found in food,
								treating them as harmful substances and triggering an allergic reaction. Symptoms can
								range from mild to severe and can include skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
								severe anaphylaxis. By identifying the specific food allergens, you can manage your food
								allergies more effectively, avoiding triggering foods and seeking appropriate treatment
								when necessary.

								<p>The Food Non-Vegetarian Allergy Panel is a comprehensive test that assesses your
									body's immune response to common non-vegetarian foods. It measures the presence and
									amount of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies your body produces in response
									to these foods.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How should I prepare for this test?</h2>
								<p>No special preparations are required for this test. Continue your normal diet and
									routine before the test.</p>

									food allergies, your doctor might advise regular testing.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
								<p>Normal values for this test will vary from one lab to another. However, generally,
									low or absent levels of specific IgE antibodies against the tested foods are
									considered normal.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do abnormal test results mean?</h2>
								<p>Abnormal test results indicate that your body is producing IgE antibodies in response
									to certain foods, suggesting that you may have a food allergy.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the results of this test?</h2>
								<p>Several factors can affect the results of this test, including your recent diet,
									current medications, and overall health status.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the modifiable factors affecting the results of this
									test?</h2>
								<p>The most modifiable factor that can affect the results of this test is your diet. If
									you've recently consumed the foods being tested, your body might produce IgE
									antibodies against them, influencing the test results.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the non-modifiable factors affecting the results of
									this test?</h2>
								<p>Non-modifiable factors that can affect the results of this test include your genetic
									predisposition to allergies. Some people are more prone to developing allergies due
									to their genetic makeup.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Which doctor should I consult if my test results are abnormal?

								<p>Symptoms of a food allergy can range from mild to severe and include skin rashes,
									hives, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anaphylaxis in severe cases.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can a food allergy develop later in life?</h2>
								<p>Yes, a food allergy can develop at any stage in life. Some people may not experience
									any symptoms until adulthood.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the consequences of not treating a food allergy?</h2>
								<p>Untreated food allergies can lead to serious health problems, including anaphylaxis,
									a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How can I manage a food allergy?</h2>
								<p>The most effective way to manage a food allergy is to avoid consuming the foods that
									trigger your symptoms. Your doctor may also recommend medications to manage allergic
									reactions.</p>
								<p>Understanding the specifics of your body's reaction to certain foods is an important
									step towards managing your health effectively. By knowing what triggers your
									allergic reactions, you can better manage your diet and lifestyle. As with any
									medical condition, it's important to consult your doctor for personalized advice
									based on your test results.</p>
