<div class="post-text">
<p>Valproic Acid, also known as Valproate, is a medication primarily used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder, and to prevent migraine headaches. It is available in oral, injectable, and intravenous forms. Valproic acid helps to restore the balance of certain natural substances in the brain, enabling it to function more normally and reducing the occurrence of abnormal electrical signals that cause seizures.</p>
<p>Monitoring the levels of valproic acid in the bloodstream is an important aspect of managing treatment with this drug. This is because the medication must be present in a certain concentration to effectively prevent seizures or mood episodes, but high levels can lead to toxicity. The therapeutic range for valproic acid in the blood is generally between 50 to 125 mcg/mL, but it can vary depending on individual circumstances.</p>
