								<p>The Allergen, Individual - Animal Pigeon Feather Diagnostic Test is an essential tool used to identify whether an individual has an allergic reaction to pigeon feathers. This test measures the levels of specific antibodies in the blood that are produced by the immune system in response to exposure to pigeon feathers. The test can be especially beneficial for individuals who interact with pigeons frequently, such as bird handlers, pet owners, or individuals living in urban environments with a high pigeon population.</p>
								<p>Allergies are essentially an overactive immune system response to substances that are generally harmless, like pigeon feathers. When the body encounters an allergen, it reacts by producing antibodies against it. This reaction can lead to symptoms that range from mild, such as itching or sneezing, to severe and potentially life-threatening.</p>
