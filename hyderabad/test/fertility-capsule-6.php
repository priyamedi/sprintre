<div class="post-text">
<p>Fertility Capsule VI is a specialized test that measures the levels of two critical hormones for fertility and reproduction, Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH). These hormones are produced by the pituitary gland and play vital roles in the reproductive systems of both men and women. FSH is responsible for the growth and maturity of ovarian follicles in women and the production of sperm in men. LH triggers ovulation in women and stimulates the production of testosterone in men. Monitoring the levels of these hormones is important, especially for those experiencing fertility issues or irregular menstrual cycles </p>
<p>Having balanced levels of FSH and LH is necessary for normal reproductive functions. This test is frequently used to evaluate fertility issues, assess menstrual irregularities, and in some cases, to monitor treatment for certain reproductive conditions.</p>
