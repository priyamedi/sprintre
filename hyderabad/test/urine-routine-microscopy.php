<div>

<p>Urine can tell us much about what’s happening inside our bodies. From the kidneys to the bladder, and even other systemic issues, urine is a treasure trove of information. Urine Routine Microscopy is one such essential diagnostic tool that aids in assessing various aspects of your health by analyzing your urine under a microscope. </p>
<p>The Urine Routine Microscopy is a combination of three tests: a visual exam, a chemical exam, and a microscopic exam. The visual exam evaluates the color and clarity of your urine. The chemical exam employs a special stick that changes color when dipped into the urine, and these color changes provide information about the levels of various substances in the urine. The microscopic exam involves observing a small amount of urine under a microscope, assessing for cells, crystals, bacteria, or any other microscopic entities.This comprehensive examination is widely used for several reasons. It can help diagnose urinary tract infections, kidney diseases, and the presence of substances that can form kidney stones. Moreover, it can be used for monitoring patients with chronic urinary system disorders and also help in detecting metabolic disorders.
