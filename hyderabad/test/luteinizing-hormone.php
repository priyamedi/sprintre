<div class="post-text">
<p>The Luteinizing Hormone (LH) Test is a blood test that measures the level of luteinizing hormone in your bloodstream. LH is produced by the pituitary gland and plays a vital role in the reproductive system. In women, LH is essential for the ovaries to release eggs, while in men, it is necessary for the production of testosterone. This test is often used to evaluate fertility issues and irregularities in menstrual cycles in women and to assess testosterone production in men. It can also be used to diagnose certain disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and pituitary disorders.</p>
<p>Understanding LH levels is essential in assessing reproductive health and diagnosing various hormonal disorders. It is often performed in conjunction with other hormonal tests for comprehensive evaluation.</p>
