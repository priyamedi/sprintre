						<div class="post-text">
							<p>The Allergy Panel - Food Spices Panel is a diagnostic test that identifies whether or not
								you are allergic to common spices, including basil (tulsi), black pepper, cardamom,
								chili pepper, clove, coriander, and mustard. This is accomplished by measuring the
								amount of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in your blood, a type of antibody that the body
								produces in response to substances it identifies as harmful.</p>
							<p>Food allergies occur when your immune system overreacts to harmless proteins found in
								certain foods. In response, it releases IgE antibodies to neutralize the perceived
								threat. This can cause a variety of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe, such as skin
								rashes, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, or anaphylaxis—a severe, potentially
								life-threatening allergic reaction. By identifying the specific spices that cause an
								allergic reaction, this test can help you manage your diet and health more effectively.
