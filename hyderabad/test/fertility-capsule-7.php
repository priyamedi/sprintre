Health (FSH, LH & Testosterone-Total) </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>Fertility Capsule VII is an essential diagnostic tool that measures the levels of three pivotal hormones in
the body - Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and Total Testosterone. These
hormones are integral for reproductive functions in both males and females. FSH is responsible for the
growth and maturation of ovarian follicles in females and the production of sperm in males. LH triggers
ovulation in females and promotes testosterone production in males. Testosterone is the primary male
sex hormone but is also important for females in small quantities. </p>
<p> Balanced levels of these hormones are vital for normal reproductive functions. The Fertility Capsule VII
test is often used to evaluate fertility issues, understand menstrual irregularities, and monitor treatment
for certain reproductive and hormonal conditions.</p>
