<div class="post-text">
<p>These tests measure the level of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood that are
associated with allergic reactions to cat dander, dog dander, horse dander, cow dander, and guinea pig
epithelium. These tests are used to diagnose and manage allergies in patients. IgE is a type of antibody
that is produced by the body's immune system in response to perceived threats such as allergens. High
levels of specific IgE antibodies in the blood can indicate an allergy to that substance. </p>
<p> Allergies occur when the immune system reacts to substances (allergens) that are generally harmless
and in most people do not cause an immune response. When a person with allergies is exposed to an
allergen, the body produces IgE antibodies against the allergen. The IgE antibodies attach to cells in the
body called mast cells causing them to release chemicals into the bloodstream, leading to symptoms of
an allergic reaction.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is dander?</h2>
<p>Dander is tiny particles of skin that had been shed from animals with fur or feathers. For people with
allergies, exposure to dander can lead to various allergic reactions, including sneezing, wheezing, and
itchiness.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is this test performed?</h2>
<p>These tests are performed to determine whether an individual has an allergy to certain animals. They
are done when a person has allergy-like symptoms after exposure to cats, dogs, horses, cows, or guinea
pigs.</p>
	<!--section achieved-->
	<?php include "../../include/iconsbox.php" ?>
	<!--//section achieved-->
	
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the test performed?</h2>
<p>The test is performed on a blood sample which is drawn from a vein in your arm.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How to interpret the results?</h2>
<p>High levels of specific IgE antibodies in your blood can mean you have an allergy to a particular
substance. However, the results should always be interpreted in conjunction with your symptoms and
clinical history.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should these tests be done?</h2>
<p>The frequency of these tests can depend on the severity of your symptoms and whether or not the
allergen can be avoided.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can allergy be cured?</h2>
<p>While allergies cannot be cured, they can be managed with avoidance measures, medications, and in
some cases, immunotherapy.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the common symptoms of an allergic reaction?</h2>
<p>Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include sneezing, itching, hives, wheezing, difficulty breathing, and
anaphylaxis in severe cases.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the treatments for allergies?</h2>
<p>Treatments can include avoiding the allergen, medications to relieve symptoms, and immunotherapy to
desensitize the body to allergens.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can an allergy test give a false negative result?</h2>
<p>Yes, it's possible for an allergy test to give a false-negative result, which means the test indicates you are
not allergic when you actually are.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can an allergy test give a false positive result?</h2>
<p>Yes, a false positive, when the test indicates that you are allergic to a substance when you actually are
not, can also occur.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How to prevent allergic reactions?</h2>
<p>The best way to prevent allergic reactions is to avoid exposure to the allergen. However, this may not
always be possible. In such cases, medications and immunotherapy can help.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the role of IgE in allergies?</h2>
<p>IgE is a type of antibody that is produced by the immune system when it overreacts to an allergen. It
triggers the release of certain chemicals that cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are allergies genetic?</h2>
<p>Yes, you're more likely to have allergies if they run in your family.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is an allergic reaction treated in an emergency?</h2>
<p>In case of a severe allergic reaction like anaphylaxis, immediate medical attention is necessary. It's
typically treated with a shot of epinephrine (adrenaline).</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is it possible to develop an allergy later in life?</h2>
<p>Yes, it is possible to develop allergies at any age. Some people may not experience an allergic reaction
until adulthood.</p>
<p>The tests are important tools in diagnosing allergies. They can provide valuable information about what
substances you may be allergic to, so that you and your doctor can develop a treatment plan to help
manage your symptoms. However, these tests are not definitive. You can have high levels of IgE
antibodies to a substance but never experience symptoms when exposed to that substance. Therefore,
these tests should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tools and clinical symptoms for an
accurate diagnosis. Always consult your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of an allergic reaction.</p>
