<div class="post-text">
<p>Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints which can cause pain, stiffness, swelling, and sometimes loss of joint function. Arthritis Panel - II is a comprehensive set of blood tests that are usually ordered together to evaluate whether a person has arthritis, and if so, what type. It is also used to monitor the disease's progression and the effectiveness of treatment. The tests in this panel include ANA (antinuclear antibodies) - IFA (immunofluorescence assay) with reflex titers, ASO (anti-streptolysin O), Calcium, CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), CRP (C-reactive protein), RF (rheumatoid factor), and Uric acid.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the Arthritis Panel - II important?
 </h2>
	<p>This panel is crucial in diagnosing various forms of arthritis, including autoimmune forms like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. It helps doctors to determine the specific type of arthritis and guide the course of treatment.
 </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What information does the Arthritis Panel - II provide?
 </h2>
	<p> The panel offers a detailed look at different aspects of your blood and immune system. ANA, for example, can indicate an autoimmune disorder. Calcium levels can be associated with various forms of arthritis. CBC gives an overview of blood cells which can indicate infection or inflammation, and so on. </p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the role of each test in Arthritis Panel - II? </h2>
	<p><ul>
		<li><b>ANA - IFA with reflex titers: </b>Detects antinuclear antibodies which are often present in autoimmune disorders.</li>
		<li><b>ASO: </b>Measures antibodies against the bacteria that cause strep throat, which might be linked to some forms of arthritis.
</li>
		<li><b>Calcium: </b>Monitors calcium levels which can be affected in certain arthritic conditions.</li>
		<li><b>CBC: </b>Gives a general overview of health and screens for a variety of disorders.</li>
		<li><b>ESR: </b>Measures how quickly red blood cells settle and is a non-specific marker of inflammation.
</li>
		<li><b>CRP: </b>A protein that increases in the blood with inflammation.
</li>
		<li><b>RF: </b>Measures the level of rheumatoid factor, an antibody present in rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
		<li><b>Uric acid:</b>Monitors levels of uric acid which can indicate gout.
</li>

	</ul> </p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required for Arthritis Panel - II? </h2>
<p>Fasting is not typically required, but always follow any preparation instructions given by the doctor or lab.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this panel be done? </h2>
<p>The frequency depends on individual circumstances, including whether a person has been diagnosed with arthritis or has risk factors for the disease.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are normal values for these tests? </h2>
<p>Normal values vary, but generally, ANA is usually reported as a titer with a normal being less than 1:40 or 1:80. ESR and CRP are markers for inflammation and normal levels are low. Uric acid normal values are 3.4 to 7.0 mg/dL for men, and 2.4 to 6.0 mg/dL for women.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors affect the levels of these tests? </h2>
<p>Medications, infections, chronic medical conditions, and physical activity can affect the levels.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should be consulted if the test values are abnormal?</h2>
<p>Consultation with a rheumatologist or a primary care doctor is recommended in case of abnormal values.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can arthritis be prevented? </h2>
<p>While not all forms of arthritis can be prevented, maintaining a healthy lifestyle including exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding excessive repetitive movements can lower the risk of developing certain types of arthritis.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the treatment options for arthritis? </h2>
<p>Treatment varies depending on the type of arthritis but may include medications, physical therapy, and in some cases, surgery.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is there a cure for arthritis? </h2>
<p>There is no cure for most forms of arthritis, but symptoms can be managed and the quality of life can be improved with proper treatment.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can children have arthritis? </h2>
<p>Yes, children can have a form of arthritis called juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is arthritis only a disease of the elderly?</h2>
<p>No, arthritis can affect individuals of all ages, though some types are more common in older adults.</p>

<p>Arthritis is a complex group of disorders with various causes and treatment options. The Arthritis Panel - II is a valuable tool in diagnosing and managing this widespread group of diseases. Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment are vital for managing the symptoms of arthritis effectively and maintaining a high quality of life. Regular check-ups and communication with your doctor are essential for anyone dealing with arthritis or experiencing symptoms associated with it.</p>
