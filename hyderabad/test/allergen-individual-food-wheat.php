<div class="post-text">
<p>Wheat is one of the most common staple foods around the world and is an essential ingredient in a variety of dishes. It is not only nutritious but also versatile. However, some individuals might have an adverse reaction to wheat, which could be due to wheat allergy. The Allergen, Individual - Food Wheat test is a diagnostic tool that helps in identifying an allergy to wheat by detecting the presence of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood. </p>
<p>Wheat allergy is an immune system reaction to proteins found in wheat. The body mistakenly identifies these proteins as harmful and responds by releasing chemicals that cause allergic symptoms. It’s essential to recognize and manage wheat allergy as it can cause discomfort and, in severe cases, life-threatening reactions. </p>
