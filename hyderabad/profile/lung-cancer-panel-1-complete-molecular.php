 </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>Lung cancer, specifically non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), often involves various genetic changes that contribute to the development and progression of the disease. Identification of these changes is critical for determining the most effective treatment approach, as some therapies target specific mutations. The Lung Cancer Panel 1 Complete Molecular is a comprehensive test designed to detect several of these genetic alterations, providing valuable information to guide treatment decisions.
 </p>
<p>The panel uses Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) PCR for EGFR mutation detection, one of the most common genetic changes in lung adenocarcinoma, a subtype of NSCLC. For the identification of ALK, ROS1, RET gene rearrangements, and MET gene amplification, Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) technique is used. These gene alterations are less common but are associated with specific subtypes of NSCLC and can be targeted by certain therapies.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is this test important?  </h2>
	<p>This test helps identify specific genetic changes that might be driving the cancer's growth. By knowing this, doctors can personalize treatment plans to target these specific changes, improving the efficacy of treatment and survival rates.
 </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the sample for this test collected? 
 </h2>
	<p>A tissue sample for this test is typically collected through a biopsy procedure, where a small piece of the tumor is removed for testing. This can be done through different methods, such as a needle biopsy, bronchoscopy, or surgery, depending on the location and size of the tumor.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I eat and drink before the test? </h2>
<p>Yes, this test doesn't require any dietary restrictions. However, if the biopsy procedure requires anesthesia, you may need to fast before the procedure. Your doctor will provide specific instructions based on your circumstances.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with this test? </h2>
<p>The risks associated with this test are primarily related to the biopsy procedure used to collect the tissue sample. These may include infection, bleeding, or complications from anesthesia. The test itself, however, does not pose any risks.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long will it take to get the results? </h2>
<p>The turnaround time for the Lung Cancer Panel 1 Complete Molecular is usually 1-2 weeks. However, this can vary depending on the laboratory processing the sample.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What if my test shows a mutation? </h2>
<p>If your test results show a mutation, your doctor will discuss the results with you and explain what they mean for your treatment options. Certain mutations may make you eligible for targeted therapies, which can be more effective and cause fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test be used to monitor my response to treatment? </h2>
<p>While this test can provide valuable information about the genetic makeup of your cancer, it is not typically used to monitor response to treatment. Other tests, such as imaging studies or blood tests, may be used for this purpose.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does it mean if no mutation is found?</h2> 
<p>If no mutation is found, it means that none of the genetic changes tested in this panel are present in your tumor. However, this doesn't mean that no mutations exist. There are many other genetic changes not included in this panel that could still be driving your cancer.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is there anyone who shouldn't have this test? </h2>
<p>This test is most useful for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma. It may not provide useful information for other types of cancer or other lung diseases.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are the results of this test always accurate?</h2> 
<p>While the techniques used in this test are highly sensitive and specific, no test is 100% accurate. There is always a small chance of false positive or false negative results. Discuss any concerns you have with your doctor.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test predict how my cancer will progress? </h2>
<p>This test can provide some information about the likely course of your disease based on the presence of certain genetic changes, but many other factors also influence cancer progression.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are the results of this test confidential?</h2> 
<p>Yes, the results of your test are confidential and are typically shared only with your healthcare team.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is this test covered by insurance? </h2>
<p>Coverage varies by insurance company and policy, so it's important to check with your insurance provider to determine if this test is covered.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test be done at any hospital?</h2>
 <p>Not all hospitals have the facilities to perform this complex test. It's usually done in specialized laboratories or larger hospitals with a dedicated pathology department.</p>
 	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I have this test done more than once?</h2> 
<p>In some cases, your doctor might recommend repeating this test if your cancer changes or progresses, or if you start a new treatment.</p>
