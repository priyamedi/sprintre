								<p>The Parvovirus B19 DNA PCR - CSF test is a specialized test that detects the presence of Parvovirus B19 DNA in your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Parvovirus B19 is a virus that can cause a variety of illnesses, from mild rash illness (fifth disease) to severe complications such as anemia and hydrops fetalis in unborn babies if the mother becomes infected during pregnancy. In rare cases, the virus can also cause neurological complications, which is why testing of CSF may be necessary.</p>
								<p>Understanding the presence of Parvovirus B19 in your CSF can be particularly useful in managing your health. It can help your doctor determine if you have been infected with the virus and if any further interventions are needed.</p>
