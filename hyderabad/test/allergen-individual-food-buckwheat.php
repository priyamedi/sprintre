<div class="post-text">
<p>Buckwheat, despite its name, is not a type of wheat but is actually a gluten-free pseudocereal. It's a nutritious food source, often consumed in the form of buckwheat flour, noodles, or groats. However, for some individuals, consumption of buckwheat can trigger an allergic reaction due to their immune system mistakenly identifying certain proteins in buckwheat as harmful.</p>

<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Buckwheat test is designed to identify an allergic response to buckwheat. This test measures the levels of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in your blood that the body produces when it encounters buckwheat and recognizes it as a potential threat.</p>
