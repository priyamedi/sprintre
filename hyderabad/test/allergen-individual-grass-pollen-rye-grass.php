<p>Rye Grass, scientifically known as Lolium, is a genus of grass that is widely cultivated for its grains and as
fodder for animals. It is also common in many lawns and fields. Like other grasses, Rye Grass produces
pollen, which can be a potent allergen for many individuals. Rye Grass allergy is often manifested as hay
fever, which is an allergic response to pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds. Getting tested for Rye
Grass pollen allergy involves a blood test that looks for specific antibodies, known as Immunoglobulin E
(IgE), that would indicate an allergic reaction to this type of pollen. </p>
