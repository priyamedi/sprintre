<div class="post-text">
<p>Carrots, with their bright color and distinctive taste, are a common food found in many dishes and cuisines around the world. Besides being a versatile culinary ingredient, carrots are also known for their health benefits, including their high vitamin A content. However, for some individuals, consuming carrots can trigger an allergic reaction. This is where the <strong>Allergen, Individual - Food Carrot</strong> test comes into play.
 </p>
<p>This test aims to identify if an individual has an allergy to carrots. It works by detecting specific antibodies, known as Immunoglobulin E (IgE), in the blood. The immune system produces these antibodies as a response to what it perceives as a harmful substance, in this case, the proteins in carrots.
