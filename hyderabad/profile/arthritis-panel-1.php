<p>Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints that can cause pain and stiffness. It can affect one joint or multiple joints. There are various types of arthritis, with different causes including wear and tear, infections, and underlying diseases. Arthritis Panel - I is a set of tests that are usually ordered together to evaluate if a person has arthritis. This panel can be extremely helpful for a doctor to diagnose arthritis and monitor the disease progression. The tests in this panel include ASO (anti-streptolysin O), Calcium, CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), CRP (C-reactive protein), RF (rheumatoid factor), and Uric acid. Each test provides different information about the body.
