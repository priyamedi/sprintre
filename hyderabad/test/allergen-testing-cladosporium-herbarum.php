							<p>In the world of allergens, Cladosporium herbarum is a common mold that can cause allergic
								reactions in sensitive individuals. Often found indoors and outdoors, this mold species
								is known for its airborne spores which can trigger various allergy symptoms. An allergen
								test specifically for Cladosporium herbarum helps identify if you have a
								hypersensitivity to this particular mold and enables the physician to develop an
								effective treatment plan.
							</p>
							<p>
								Allergies occur when your immune system overreacts to substances that are typically
								harmless, such as certain molds like Cladosporium herbarum. This reaction can trigger
								symptoms ranging from mild, such as sneezing and itching, to severe, like difficulty
								breathing. By assessing your body’s immune response to specific allergens, the allergen
								testing can pinpoint the cause of your allergy symptoms.
