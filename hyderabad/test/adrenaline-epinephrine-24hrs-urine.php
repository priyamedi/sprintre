					<div class="post-text">
								<p>The 24-hour urinary <strong>adrenaline (epinephrine) test</strong> measures the amount of adrenaline, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, in your urine over a 24-hour period. Adrenaline plays a crucial role in your body's response to stress, increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and energy supplies. Abnormal adrenaline levels could indicate various health conditions, including adrenal tumors and certain genetic disorders. <br><br>
								Understanding your urinary adrenaline levels can help your healthcare provider diagnose these conditions, guide treatment strategies, and monitor your health over time.
