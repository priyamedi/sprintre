								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is Alpha Feto Protein?</h2>
								<p>Alpha Feto Protein (AFP) is a protein produced by the liver and yolk sac of a
									developing fetus. It's involved in the growth and development of the fetus and its
									production decreases significantly after birth. In adults, its levels are typically
									very low, but can be elevated in certain conditions.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is AFP measured in cerebrospinal fluid?</h2>
								<p>The measurement of AFP in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is often used in the
									diagnostic evaluation of certain types of brain and spinal cord tumors, particularly
									those derived from germ cells. Elevated levels of AFP in the CSF can be suggestive
									of these types of tumors.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the test for Alpha Feto Protein in CSF performed?</h2>
								<p>The test is performed on a sample of cerebrospinal fluid. This is typically obtained
									through a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) procedure, where a needle is inserted into
									the lower part of the spinal column to withdraw a small amount of CSF for testing.
								</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When might a healthcare provider order an Alpha Feto Protein
									test on CSF?</h2>
								<p>A healthcare provider might order an AFP test on CSF if a patient presents with
									neurological symptoms that suggest the presence of a central nervous system tumor.
									The test can provide valuable information to help diagnose and classify the tumor.
								</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How are the test results interpreted?</h2>
								<p>Results are typically reported in concentration (like nanograms per milliliter). High
									levels of AFP in CSF may suggest the presence of a germ cell tumor in the central
									nervous system.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does it mean if the AFP levels are high in CSF?</h2>
								<p>High levels of AFP in CSF can suggest the presence of a germ cell tumor, such as a
									yolk sac tumor or a mixed germ cell tumor, in the brain or spinal cord. It's
									important to note that AFP is not solely specific to these conditions and elevated
									levels can also be seen in other situations.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can influence the test results?</h2>
								<p>Certain medications and conditions can affect the level of AFP. In the context of
									CSF, elevated levels of AFP are most often associated with the presence of germ cell
									tumors, but can also be affected by the presence of other types of cancers or
									non-cancerous conditions.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the risks associated with the lumbar puncture
									procedure?</h2>
								<p>While a lumbar puncture is generally safe, it does come with a small risk of
									complications. These can include headache, infection, bleeding, and, in rare cases,
									damage to the spinal cord or nerves.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can I prepare for the test?</h2>
								<p>There's no special preparation required for an AFP test. However, because it involves
									a lumbar puncture, you may be asked to fast for a few hours before the procedure.
									You should also inform your doctor about any medications you're taking as some could
									affect the procedure or test results.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What happens after the test?</h2>
								<p>After the test, you'll likely need to rest flat on your back for a short while to
									reduce the risk of headache. You should avoid strenuous activities for the rest of
									the day. You can resume your regular activities and diet after the procedure, unless
									instructed otherwise by your healthcare provider.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> When will I receive the test results?</h2>
								<p>The turnaround time for AFP in CSF is typically 2-3 days. However, the exact timing
									may depend on the laboratory performing the test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How often should this test be done?</h2>
								<p>The frequency of testing would depend on the individual patient's symptoms and
									medical condition. If a germ cell tumor is suspected, your healthcare provider may
									recommend regular testing to monitor for changes in AFP levels.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can other proteins be tested in CSF?</h2>
								<p>Yes, in addition to AFP, other proteins can be measured in CSF to help determine the
									cause of neurological symptoms. These may include Beta-2 Transferrin, IgG Index, and
									others, depending on the condition being investigated.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What other tests might be performed along with AFP in CSF?
								</h2>
								<p>Other tests often performed in conjunction with AFP testing in CSF include cell
									count, glucose, protein levels, and cultures to check for infection. Additionally,
									other tumor markers like Beta-HCG may be measured.</p>
								<p>This information should be interpreted in the context of the patient's symptoms,
									medical history, and other test results. It is always advised to discuss these test
									results and any concerns with your healthcare provider.</p>
