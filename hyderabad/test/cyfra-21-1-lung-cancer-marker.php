 </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>Cyfra 21-1 is a tumor marker that is used in the monitoring and management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is a fragment of cytokeratin 19, a protein found in epithelial cells. In healthy individuals, Cyfra 21-1 levels are usually low. However, in certain conditions, including lung cancer, levels of Cyfra 21-1 may be elevated. This test measures the levels of Cyfra 21-1 in the blood </p>
<p>It is important to note that Cyfra 21-1 is not a definitive diagnostic tool for lung cancer but is rather used in conjunction with other tests and clinical evaluations. It can provide valuable information on the stage of the disease, efficacy of treatment, and monitoring for recurrence after treatment.

<p>No, fasting is not required for the Cyfra 21-1 test.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is it important to monitor Cyfra 21-1 levels?</h2>
<p> Monitoring Cyfra 21-1 levels is important in evaluating how well a patient with non-small cell lung cancer is responding to treatment, and for early detection of disease recurrence.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should I get this test? </h2>
<p>Your doctor will recommend the Cyfra 21-1 test if you have been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer and it's necessary to monitor the progression or response to treatment.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for Cyfra 21-1?</h2>
<p> Normal values for Cyfra 21-1 are typically less than 3.3 ng/mL, but this can vary depending on the laboratory that analyzes the test.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does it mean if my Cyfra 21-1 levels are high?</h2>
<p> High levels of Cyfra 21-1 may indicate the presence or progression of non-small cell lung cancer. However, elevated levels can sometimes be due to other factors or conditions.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any factors that can affect Cyfra 21-1 levels?</h2>
<p> Yes, smoking, inflammation, and some benign diseases can affect Cyfra 21-1 levels.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What type of doctor should I see if my Cyfra 21-1 levels are abnormal?</h2>
 <p>You should consult an oncologist if your Cyfra 21-1 levels are abnormal.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can changes in lifestyle affect Cyfra 21-1 levels? </h2>
<p>Quitting smoking and maintaining a healthy lifestyle may have a positive effect on your overall health but it's unclear how directly it affects Cyfra 21-1 levels.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Is Cyfra 21-1 test used to diagnose lung cancer? </h2>
<p>No, Cyfra 21-1 is not used as a standalone diagnostic tool for lung cancer. It is used alongside other tests and evaluations.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can Cyfra 21-1 levels be used to determine the stage of lung cancer?</h2>
 <p>Yes, higher levels of Cyfra 21-1 are often associated with more advanced stages of non-small cell lung cancer.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How often should I get the Cyfra 21-1 test?</h2> 
<p>The frequency of the Cyfra 21-1 test depends on various factors such as the stage of cancer, the type of treatment, and your doctor’s recommendations.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Are there any precautions I should take before undergoing this test? </h2>
<p>There are no specific precautions. However, it’s always good to inform your doctor of any medications or supplements you are taking.</p>

<p>No, the Cyfra 21-1 test cannot be done at home. It requires a blood sample to be taken by a healthcare professional and analyzed in a laboratory.</p>

 <p>Cyfra 21-1 is an important biomarker for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. It can help in monitoring the disease and evaluating the effectiveness of treatment. It is not a definitive diagnostic tool and should be used as part of a comprehensive approach to managing lung cancer. Regular consultations with your doctor are crucial for proper monitoring and management of your condition.</p>
