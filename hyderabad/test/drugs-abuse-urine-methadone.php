<div class="post-text">
<p>Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is commonly used as part of a treatment program for addiction to heroin or other opioids. It helps to alleviate withdrawal symptoms and is also used as a pain reliever. The <b>Drugs Of Abuse - Urine: Methadone</b> test is utilized to detect the presence of methadone in the urine. This is essential in monitoring patients on methadone maintenance programs, for employment drug screenings, or in cases where methadone use is suspected.</p>
<p>Despite its benefits in treating opioid addiction, methadone itself can be habit-forming and misuse can lead to overdose or even death. Monitoring methadone levels is crucial in ensuring that the drug is being used appropriately and safely.
