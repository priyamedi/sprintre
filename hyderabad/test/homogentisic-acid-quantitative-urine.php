<div class="post-text">
<p>The <strong>Homogentisic Acid (Alkaptonuria) test</strong> is a specialized urine analysis that detects levels of homogentisic acid, an amino acid metabolite. The test is typically used to diagnose Alkaptonuria, a rare inherited disorder that affects the body's ability to properly break down certain amino acids.
 </p>
<p><strong>Alkaptonuria</strong> is characterized by a buildup of homogentisic acid in the body, leading to dark-colored urine and potentially damaging connective tissues over time (a condition known as ochronosis), which may affect the heart, kidney, and joints. Diagnosing Alkaptonuria early allows for better management of <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms"><b style="color:#2C53A5">symptoms</b></a>, though there is currently no cure for the disease </p>
