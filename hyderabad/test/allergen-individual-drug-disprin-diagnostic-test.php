								<p>The Allergen, Individual - Drug Disprin Diagnostic Test is a significant medical examination aimed at identifying if an individual has an allergic reaction to the medication Disprin. Disprin, containing aspirin, is commonly used to relieve minor aches and pains and reduce fever. The test measures the levels of specific antibodies generated by the immune system in response to exposure to Disprin. <br><br>
Allergies are an overreaction of the immune system to substances usually considered harmless. When the body encounters an allergen, such as Disprin, it produces antibodies to combat it, resulting in symptoms varying from mild (such as rash or itching) to severe and potentially life-threatening.
