<div class="post-text">
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Lentil test is a diagnostic assessment that determines if an individual is allergic to lentils. Lentils are legumes that are often consumed for their high protein and fiber content. They are a staple in many cuisines around the world. However, like other foods, some individuals may be allergic to lentils. This test detects the presence of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood, which are produced in response to an allergen. In the case of a lentil allergy, these antibodies react with proteins in lentils. </p>
<p>Lentil allergy is relatively rare compared to other food allergies, but can still have significant effects on those who are allergic. Lentil proteins can trigger an immune response in some people, leading to various symptoms and discomfort. </p>
