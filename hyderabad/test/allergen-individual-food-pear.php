<div class="post-text">
<p>Pears are a popular fruit enjoyed by many across the world. They are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients and are a part of a healthy diet. However, for a minority of individuals, consuming pears or products made from pears can lead to allergic reactions. Allergic reactions to pears are usually due to proteins in the pear that the immune system mistakenly identifies as harmful. The Allergen, Individual - Food Pear test is designed to detect an allergy to pears. It does this by measuring the level of specific antibodies, called Immunoglobulin E (IgE), in the blood.</p>
<p>When an individual who is allergic to pears consumes the fruit, the immune system reacts to the proteins and prompts the release of IgE antibodies. These antibodies attempt to neutralize what the body perceives as foreign substances. The release of these antibodies causes the symptoms of an allergic reaction.
