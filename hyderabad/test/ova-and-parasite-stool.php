								<p>The Ova and Parasite - Stool: Comprehensive Examination with Coccidia Evaluation is an important
diagnostic test used to detect parasites and their eggs (ova) in a stool sample. This test is particularly
useful in diagnosing infections caused by parasites, including coccidia, which can cause gastrointestinal
symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea.<br>
Parasitic infections can occur when you ingest contaminated food or water, or come into contact with
infected individuals or animals. Coccidia are a type of microscopic parasites that can infect the intestinal
tract, causing a condition known as coccidiosis. This test helps in the early detection of such infections,
enabling prompt treatment and prevention of complications.</p>
