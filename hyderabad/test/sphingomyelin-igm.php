<div class="post-text">
<p>The Sphingomyelin-IgM (Phospholipid) Test is a blood test that measures the levels of antibodies (IgM) against sphingomyelin, a type of phospholipid found in cell membranes. This test is primarily used to help diagnose and monitor autoimmune disorders, where the immune system mistakenly targets normal constituents of the body, including phospholipids like sphingomyelin. </p>
<p>Sphingomyelin is a component of cell membranes, and antibodies against it can be associated with various autoimmune disorders. Elevated levels of IgM antibodies to sphingomyelin might indicate an underlying autoimmune disorder, such as antiphospholipid syndrome or lupus. The test provides valuable information that helps doctors in the diagnosis and management of these conditions. </p>
