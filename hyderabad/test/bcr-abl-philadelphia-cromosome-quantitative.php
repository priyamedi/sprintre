<div class="post-text">
<p>The BCR/ABL - Philadelphia Chromosome (IS - International Scale) Quantitative test is a crucial diagnostic and monitoring tool in the field of hematology, especially concerning Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). The test is intended to detect and measure the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene that results from a specific chromosomal abnormality known as the Philadelphia chromosome.
 </p>
<p>CML is a slow-growing blood cancer that originates in the bone marrow, causing excessive growth of white blood cells. It is typically associated with the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, a mutation that leads to the formation of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. This gene is responsible for promoting uncontrolled cell division, leading to the symptoms of CML. Understanding the quantitative measurement of this gene plays a significant role in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of CML.
 </p>
 <p>This test utilizes real-time quantitative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to detect and measure the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene in the blood or bone marrow. The results are reported on an International Scale (IS), which allows for standardization and comparability of results across different laboratories worldwide.
</p>
<p>The test is essential not only for confirming the diagnosis of CML but also for monitoring the patient's response to treatment. Depending on the reduction of the BCR-ABL1 gene level over time, doctors can assess whether a patient is responding well to treatment or if a change in therapeutic strategy is required.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When is the BCR/ABL - Philadelphia Chromosome (IS - International Scale) Quantitative test ordered?
 </h2>
	<p>This test is typically ordered when CML is suspected based on symptoms, complete blood count results, and bone marrow examination. It is then repeated periodically to monitor the disease progression and response to treatment.
 </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How does the BCR/ABL - Philadelphia Chromosome (IS - International Scale) Quantitative test work?
 </h2>
	<p>The test uses real-time quantitative PCR to amplify and detect the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene in a sample of the patient's blood or bone marrow. The amount of BCR-ABL1 gene present is compared to a control gene to calculate the ratio, which is then reported on an International Scale (IS).

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do the results mean?</h2>
<p>The results show the level of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene in the patient's sample. A high level suggests the presence of CML. The level of this gene should decrease with effective treatment. A failure for the levels to decrease or a sudden increase might suggest resistance to treatment.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the sample requirement for this test?</h2>
<p>The test requires a sample of the patient's blood or bone marrow.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the test results?</h2>
<p>Various factors can affect the results, including sample quality, stage of the disease, and the method of testing. The presence of other genetic mutations may also influence the BCR-ABL1 gene level.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What happens if the test results are abnormal?</h2>
<p>If the test results are abnormal, it suggests the presence of CML or resistance to the current treatment. Your doctor will discuss the results with you and suggest the next steps, which might include changes in treatment or further investigations.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is this test painful?</h2>
<p>Blood collection is usually a simple procedure with minor discomfort. However, bone marrow collection is more invasive and can cause temporary pain or discomfort.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be performed?</h2>
<p>The frequency of the test depends on various factors such as the stage of the disease and the response to treatment. Your doctor will advise you based on your individual condition.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should I take before and after the test?</h2>
<p>No special precautions are necessary before or after the test. You can continue with your regular activities unless your doctor advises otherwise.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult if the test results are abnormal?</h2>
<p>You should consult a hematologist or oncologist if the test results are abnormal. They can provide further guidance and treatment options based on your specific condition.</p>

<p>The BCR/ABL - Philadelphia Chromosome (IS - International Scale) Quantitative test is an indispensable tool in the diagnosis and management of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. The test, by quantifying the level of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, can guide the doctor in understanding the stage of the disease, planning the treatment strategy, and monitoring the response to treatment. Always remember, effective communication with your doctor is the cornerstone of good health.</p>
