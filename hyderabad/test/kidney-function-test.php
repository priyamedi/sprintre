<div>

<p>Kidneys are fundamental organs in the human body that perform numerous functions including filtering
waste products, excess nutrients, and electrolytes from the blood, forming urine. They also play a vital
role in maintaining proper balance of body fluids, regulating blood pressure, and ensuring the
production of red blood cells. Monitoring the health of your kidneys is crucial, and Kidney Function Tests
are essential diagnostic tools for this purpose. </p>
<p> Kidney Function Tests encompass a series of tests that help evaluate how effectively your kidneys are
working. These tests include Serum Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Estimated Glomerular
Filtration Rate (eGFR), and Urinalysis. The Serum Creatinine and BUN tests measure the concentration of
waste products in blood, whereas eGFR estimates how well your kidneys are filtering small molecules
like creatinine. Urinalysis involves the examination of urine for abnormalities.The Kidney Function Tests
are crucial for diagnosing and managing kidney diseases. Additionally, they are vital for individuals who
have conditions that predispose them to kidney dysfunction, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.</p>

<li> <p> <strong>Fasting : </strong> <p> Usually not required, but follow your doctor’s instructions.</p> </li>
<li> <p> <strong>Medications and Supplements : </strong> <p> Inform your doctor about any medications or supplements you
are taking, as some can affect the test results.</p> </li>
<li> <p> <strong>Hydration : </strong> <p> It’s important to be properly hydrated for accurate results. Don’t overhydrate or
dehydrate before the test.</p> </li>
<li> <p> <strong>Exercise : </strong> <p> Avoid vigorous exercise the day before the test as it can temporarily elevate creatinine
levels.</p> </li>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does a Kidney Function Test include?</h2>
<p>
Kidney Function Test includes Serum Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Estimated Glomerular
Filtration Rate (eGFR), and Urinalysis. These tests assess how well the kidneys are working by measuring
the levels of waste products and other chemicals in the blood and urine.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Why is it important to have Kidney Function Tests?</h2>
<p>
Kidney Function Tests are important to diagnose and monitor kidney diseases, and they are also critical
for individuals with conditions that can affect the kidneys like diabetes or high blood pressure.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How are Kidney Function Tests performed?</h2>
<p>
Kidney Function Tests involve taking blood samples and a urine sample. The blood samples are tested
for creatinine and BUN, and eGFR is calculated. The urine sample is analyzed for various substances.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What do the results of Kidney Function Tests mean?</h2>
<p>

High levels of creatinine and BUN may indicate that the kidneys are not filtering waste efficiently. eGFR
values below 60 may suggest kidney dysfunction. Abnormalities in the urine can also indicate kidney
problems.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the normal values for Kidney Function Tests?</h2>
<p>
Normal values can vary, but generally: Serum Creatinine: 0.6-1.2 mg/dL for men, 0.5-1.1 mg/dL for
women; BUN: 6-20 mg/dL; eGFR: above 90 is considered normal but values down to 60 are acceptable.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How can I improve my kidney function?</h2>
<p>
Maintaining a balanced diet, exercising regularly, staying hydrated, avoiding tobacco, and regularly
monitoring blood pressure and blood sugar can help in improving kidney function.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can a person live with one kidney?</h2>
<p>
Yes, it’s possible to live a normal life with one kidney. The remaining kidney can adapt and compensate
for the loss of the other.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the symptoms of kidney diseases?</h2>
<p>
Symptoms include swelling in legs, ankles, and feet, decreased urine output, shortness of breath,
fatigue, nausea, and confusion.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is chronic kidney disease?</h2>
<p>
Chronic kidney disease is a long-term condition where the kidneys gradually lose their function over
time. It can be due to various causes including diabetes, high blood pressure, and recurrent kidney
infections.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How is kidney disease treated?</h2>
<p>
Treatment depends on the stage and cause of kidney disease and may include lifestyle changes,
medications, dialysis, or in severe cases, a kidney transplant.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can medications affect kidney function?</h2>
<p>
Yes, certain medications, especially over-the-counter painkillers and some prescription drugs, can affect
kidney function.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How often should I have Kidney Function Tests done?</h2>
<p>
This depends on your health conditions. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, or known kidney
diseases should have these tests more frequently.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can a Kidney Function Test detect a urinary tract infection (UTI)?</h2>
<p>

A urinalysis, which is part of the Kidney Function Test, can sometimes detect a UTI by identifying
bacteria or white blood cells in the urine.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult if my Kidney Function Test results are abnormal?</h2>
<p>
You should consult your primary care doctor who may then refer you to a nephrologist if necessary.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the role of the kidneys in blood pressure regulation?</h2>
<p>
Kidneys play a critical role in blood pressure regulation by controlling the fluid balance and releasing
hormones that regulate blood pressure.</p>
<p>Understanding the importance of your kidneys and the role they play in your overall health is crucial.
Through Kidney Function Tests, you can gain insights into your renal health and take appropriate
measures if needed. Whether you’re managing an existing condition or trying to prevent future
ailments, being proactive and staying informed is key. Consult your doctor for tailored advice and
maintain a healthy lifestyle for your kidneys to function efficiently.</p>
