<div class="post-text">
<p>Cultivated wheat, known scientifically as Triticum aestivum, is one of the most widely cultivated cereal
grains worldwide. It's a staple food used in the production of flour for bread, pasta, and various other
food products. However, during the pollination season, wheat plants release pollen which can be a
source of allergens for certain individuals. Wheat pollen allergy is less common than wheat protein
allergy but can cause symptoms in sensitized individuals.
 </p>
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Grass Pollen Cultivated Wheat test is used to determine if an individual is
allergic to wheat pollen. This is done by detecting specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the
blood, which are produced in response to an allergen such as wheat pollen. </p>
