							<p>Helminthosporium Halodes is a type of fungi widely dispersed in nature and found in soil,
								plants, and various organic materials. Some individuals are sensitive to this mold, and
								exposure may cause an allergic reaction. The Allergen, Individual - Microorganism
								Helminthosporium Halodes test helps to identify an allergy to this mold by measuring the
								specific antibodies (IgE) the body produces in response to it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Allergic reactions are caused by the immune system's excessive response to allergens,
								harmless substances that the body mistakenly identifies as harmful. The immune system
								then releases chemicals to combat these perceived threats, leading to symptoms of
								allergy. With exposure to Helminthosporium Halodes, individuals may experience symptoms
								such as coughing, sneezing, skin rashes, and eye irritation.
