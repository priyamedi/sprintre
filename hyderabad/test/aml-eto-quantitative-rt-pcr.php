								<p>The RT-PCR for AML/ETO Quantitative test is a molecular diagnostic procedure performed on a blood or
								bone marrow sample. This test is primarily used to diagnose and monitor the progress of Acute Myeloid
								Leukemia (AML), a type of blood cancer. AML is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that
								build up in the bone marrow and blood, interfering with normal blood cell production. <br><br>
								The AML/ETO (also known as RUNX1/ETO or t(8;21)) gene fusion is one of the most common genetic
								abnormalities associated with AML. It is created by the translocation (exchange of genetic material)
								between chromosomes 8 and 21. This test uses the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-
								PCR) technique to detect and quantify this gene fusion in a patient's blood or bone marrow.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the RT-PCR for AML/ETO Quantitative test important?</h2>
								<p>The RT-PCR for AML/ETO Quantitative test is crucial for the diagnosis of AML. It can also be used to
monitor treatment response in patients with AML and help predict their prognosis.</p>
								
							
								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Do I need to fast before this test?</h2>
								<p>No, fasting is not necessary before this test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What type of sample is needed for this test?</h2>
								<p>A blood sample or bone marrow sample is required for this test.</p>
								
								
								
								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should I get this test?</h2>
								<p>This test is usually ordered if you have signs or symptoms suggestive of AML, or if you&#39;ve been
diagnosed with AML and your doctor wants to monitor your response to treatment.</p>
								
								
								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What information does this test provide?</h2>
								<p>This test detects and quantifies the AML/ETO gene fusion in your blood or bone marrow. The presence
of this fusion gene indicates AML, and its quantity can help assess the severity of the disease and the
effectiveness of treatment.</p>
								 	
								
								
								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I be tested?</h2>
								<p>Your healthcare provider will determine the frequency of this test based on your health condition and
response to treatment.</p>
								
								
								
								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
								<p>The absence of the AML/ETO gene fusion is considered normal. However, if you have been diagnosed
with AML, the goal is to reduce the levels of this gene fusion as much as possible with treatment.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should I take before undergoing this test?</h2>
								<p>No special precautions are necessary before this test. However, inform your doctor about any
medications you're taking, as some may interfere with the test results.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can anything affect my test results?</h2>
								<p>Certain medications and the presence of other genetic abnormalities may affect the test results.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult if my test results are abnormal?</h2>
								<p>If your test results are abnormal, you should consult with a hematologist or an oncologist.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What conditions can cause changes in AML/ETO levels?</h2>
								<p>The presence and increased levels of the AML/ETO gene fusion are primarily associated with Acute
Myeloid Leukemia. Its levels can decrease with effective treatment.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What happens during the sample collection process?</h2>
								<p>A healthcare professional will clean your skin, insert a needle into a vein to draw blood, or perform a
bone marrow aspiration or biopsy to collect a marrow sample. The needle is then removed, and a bandage is applied to the puncture site.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with the collection of a blood sample?</h2>
								<p>Risks associated with blood sample collection are minimal and can include slight pain, bruising at the
puncture site, or lightheadedness.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How should I prepare for this test?</h2>
								<p>No special preparation is required for this test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test be used to predict the progression of AML?</h2>
								<p>Yes, the RT-PCR for AML/ETO Quantitative test can help predict the progression of AML. High levels of
the AML/ETO fusion gene are typically associated with more aggressive disease.</p>

								
								<p>In conclusion, the RT-PCR for AML/ETO Quantitative test is a valuable tool in diagnosing and monitoring
AML. If you have been diagnosed with AML, understanding your test results can be crucial in managing
your disease. Always discuss your results with your healthcare provider to understand what they mean
for your specific situation.</p>
