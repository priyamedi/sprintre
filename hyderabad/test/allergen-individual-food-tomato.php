<div class="post-text">
<p>Tomatoes, known for their rich taste and versatility, are a staple in many diets across the world. They are often used in salads, sauces, soups, and various dishes. Besides being delicious, tomatoes are packed with essential nutrients such as vitamins A, C, and K, as well as significant antioxidants like lycopene. However, for some individuals, consuming tomatoes may lead to allergic reactions. The Allergen, Individual - Food Tomato test is an essential diagnostic tool that helps in identifying whether an individual has an allergy to tomatoes.
 </p>
<p>This test examines a blood sample for the presence of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies specific to proteins found in tomatoes. When the body’s immune system wrongly identifies tomato proteins as harmful, it responds by producing IgE antibodies. This test is critical for those who experience adverse reactions after consuming tomatoes, as it can confirm or rule out an allergy.
