<div class="post-text">
<p>Wool is a textile fabric derived from sheep and certain other animals, including cashmere and mohair
from goats, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids. While it is a highly valued fabric
for its warmth and durability, exposure to wool can, unfortunately, trigger allergic reactions in some
individuals. This guide aims to offer detailed information about the <strong>Wool Allergy Test</strong>. </p>
<p>Wool allergies occur when the immune system identifies wool as a harmful substance and initiates a
defensive response. This response involves the production of antibodies, specifically Immunoglobulin E
(IgE), that trigger the release of chemicals such as histamines leading to the symptoms of an allergic
reaction. </p>
<p>A <strong>Wool Allergy Test</strong> is an IgE antibody test conducted on a blood sample. The presence of specific IgE
antibodies to wool in your blood signals an allergic response to this textile fabric.</p>
