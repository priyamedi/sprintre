<div class="post-text">
<p>Pityrosporum orbiculare, also known as Malassezia furfur, is a yeast-like fungus found on the skin's surface. For most people, this organism is harmless. However, in some individuals, it can cause an allergic reaction or contribute to skin conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis, pityriasis versicolor, and atopic eczema. This article aims to provide you with all the information you need to understand a Pityrosporum orbiculare allergy.
 </p>
<p>Pityrosporum orbiculare is a common fungus that naturally lives on our skin. Under certain conditions, like a warm, humid environment or an impaired immune system, it can overgrow and cause skin conditions or trigger allergic reactions. These allergies can be challenging to manage because Pityrosporum orbiculare is a normal part of the human microbiome and is present almost everywhere.
 </p>
 <p>The allergic reaction to Pityrosporum orbiculare is detected by a specific IgE blood test, which measures the amount of IgE antibodies in your blood that are specific for this allergen. This information can help your doctor diagnose an allergy to Pityrosporum orbiculare and recommend appropriate treatment.
