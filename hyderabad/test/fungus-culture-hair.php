<div class="post-text">
<p>A Fungus Culture from hair is a laboratory test used to diagnose fungal infections affecting the hair and scalp. Such infections are often referred to as tinea capitis or ringworm of the scalp. These infections are common in children but can affect individuals of all ages. The infection may cause patchy hair loss, itching, and scaly patches on the scalp </p>
<p>Fungi are microorganisms that thrive in warm and moist environments. In some cases, certain fungi can colonize the hair and scalp, leading to infection. These infections can be caused by various types of fungi, and knowing the specific type is important for effective treatment. </p>
<p>Hair samples are collected and sent to a laboratory, where they are cultured in an environment that promotes fungal growth. The type of fungus is identified under a microscope or through other laboratory techniques.</p>
