<div class="post-text">
<p>A Fungus Culture [STOOL] test is used to detect and identify fungi in the stool sample. This test is helpful when a healthcare provider suspects a fungal infection in the digestive system. Certain fungi can cause illness if they grow excessively in the body or if they occur in people with weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>For this test, a stool sample is collected and sent to the lab. The sample is then placed on a culture medium that promotes the growth of fungi, and it is incubated for a certain period. After incubation, any fungal growth is examined and identified using microscopic examination and other testing methods. The test results can help guide the treatment plan and provide crucial information on the patient's health status.</p>
