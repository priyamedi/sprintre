<div class="post-text">
<p>The Placental Growth Factor (PLGF) test is a blood test that measures the levels of PLGF in your blood. PLGF is a protein that is produced by the placenta during pregnancy. It plays a crucial role in the growth and development of the placenta and fetus.</p>

<p>This test is particularly important for pregnant women, especially those at risk of complications such as preeclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure and damage to other organs, often the liver and kidneys. Low levels of PLGF can be an indicator of preeclampsia and other pregnancy-related complications.</p>
