<div class="post-text">

<p>The Serotonin - Urine test is a key diagnostic tool for determining the level of serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxy tryptamine, in the urine. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter primarily found in the brain, bowels, and blood platelets, is widely recognized for its role in promoting feelings of well-being and happiness. However, it also performs critical functions in mood regulation, appetite, sleep, and certain cognitive functions, including memory and learning.</p>

<p>Abnormally high or low levels of serotonin can indicate various conditions, including mood disorders, carcinoid syndrome, and certain heart and neurological disorders. By performing the Serotonin - Urine test, clinicians can gain a clearer understanding of these conditions, helping to guide diagnosis and treatment.</p>
