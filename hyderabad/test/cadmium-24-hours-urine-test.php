<p>The Cadmium, 24 Hours Urine Test is an investigation that measures the levels of cadmium in your urine over a 24-hour period. Cadmium is a metal found in the earth's crust that is often released into the environment through human activities such as mining, burning coal, and manufacturing of batteries, pigments, metal coatings, and plastics. Cadmium can enter the body through the consumption of contaminated food and water or inhalation of cadmium-laden dust and smoke. </p>
<p>Exposure to high levels of cadmium can be harmful. The kidneys and lungs are particularly vulnerable to damage from cadmium exposure. In some cases, excessive exposure can lead to a condition called "Itai-Itai" disease, which causes severe bone and joint pain. Therefore, this test is crucial for individuals exposed to environments where cadmium is used or released, such as industrial workplaces or contaminated sites.
