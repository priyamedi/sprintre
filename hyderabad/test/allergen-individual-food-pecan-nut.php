<div class="post-text">
<p>Pecan nuts are a popular type of nuts that are not only delicious but also nutritious. They are rich in healthy fats, fiber, and various vitamins and minerals. However, for some individuals, consumption of pecan nuts can cause an allergic reaction. This allergy is often due to proteins in the pecan nuts that the immune system mistakenly identifies as harmful. The Allergen, Individual - Food Pecan Nut test is aimed at detecting an allergy to pecan nuts by measuring the levels of specific antibodies, known as Immunoglobulin E (IgE), in the blood.</p>
<p>When an individual who is allergic to pecan nuts consumes them, the immune system reacts by producing IgE antibodies. These antibodies bind to the proteins in pecan nuts and trigger an allergic reaction, which can vary from mild to severe.
