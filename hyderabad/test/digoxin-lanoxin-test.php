<p>Digoxin is a medication that is commonly used to treat heart conditions such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The Digoxin (Lanoxin) Test is a blood test that measures the level of digoxin in the blood to ensure that it is within the therapeutic range that is effective but not toxic. This is important because the difference between an effective dose and a toxic dose of digoxin is small. Having too much or too little digoxin in the blood can be harmful.</p>

<p>This medication helps by strengthening the contractions of the heart, which can be beneficial in conditions where the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should. It also helps to regulate the heartbeat. Because of the medication’s narrow therapeutic index, monitoring is essential to make sure that you are getting the correct dose.</p>
