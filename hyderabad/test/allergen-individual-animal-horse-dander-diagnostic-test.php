								<p>The Allergen, Individual - Animal Horse Dander Diagnostic Test is a specialized test used to determine if an individual is allergic to horse dander. The test measures the amount of specific antibodies, produced by the immune system in response to exposure to horse dander. This test is particularly beneficial for people who often come into contact with horses, including horse owners, equestrians, stable workers, and veterinarians.</p>
								<p>Allergies represent an overactive response of the immune system to typically harmless substances, such as horse dander. When the body encounters an allergen, it reacts by producing antibodies against it. This response can trigger symptoms ranging from mild, such as sneezing or itching, to severe and potentially life-threatening.</p>
