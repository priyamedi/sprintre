<h1 class="test-h1">Testosterone - Total Diagnostic Test </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>Testosterone, a primary sex hormone in males and a secondary sex hormone in females, plays an essential role in various physiological processes. In males, it is primarily responsible for the development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as facial hair, deep voice, and muscle development. In females, it is crucial for bone health and sexual drive. A testosterone total test measures the total amount of testosterone in the blood, including the hormone bound to proteins and that circulating freely. </p>
<p>The testosterone total test is a reliable diagnostic tool that provides a comprehensive overview of testosterone levels in the body. This test is ordered if a person exhibits symptoms of abnormal testosterone levels. For instance, in men, symptoms like erectile dysfunction, reduced sexual drive, and infertility might indicate low testosterone levels. In women, high testosterone levels might cause symptoms like excess hair growth, acne, and irregular menstrual cycles. </p>
