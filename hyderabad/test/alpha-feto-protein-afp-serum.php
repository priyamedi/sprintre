							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is Alpha Feto Protein?</h2>
								<p>Alpha Feto Protein (AFP) is a protein that's produced mainly by the liver and yolk
									sac of a developing fetus. AFP levels are usually low in healthy adults but can
									increase with certain types of cancer, especially liver cancer, as well as other
									liver diseases. AFP is often used as a tumor marker in adults.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is AFP measured in the serum?</h2>
								<p>Serum AFP testing is typically performed to monitor and diagnose certain diseases.
									Elevated AFP levels in adults can be a sign of liver disease, liver cancer, or
									cancers of the testes or ovaries. It can also be used to monitor the effectiveness
									of treatment for these types of cancer.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the test for AFP in serum performed?</h2>
								<p>The test is performed on a sample of blood. A needle is inserted into a vein,
									typically in your arm, to collect the blood sample. The blood sample is then sent to
									a laboratory, where the AFP levels are measured.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When might a healthcare provider order an AFP test?</h2>
								<p>A healthcare provider might order an AFP test if a patient has symptoms that suggest
									liver disease or cancer, or if the patient has certain risk factors for these
									conditions. This test can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for
									liver cancer, testicular cancer, and ovarian cancer.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How are the test results interpreted?</h2>
								<p>Results are usually reported in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). High levels of AFP
									can suggest the presence of certain conditions, such as liver disease or cancer.
									However, the AFP test is not definitive—other tests will be necessary to confirm a
									diagnosis.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does it mean if the AFP levels are high in the serum?</h2>
								<p>High levels of AFP in the serum can be a sign of liver disease or certain types of
									cancer, including liver, testes, and ovaries. It's important to note that AFP is not
									solely specific to these conditions and elevated levels can also be seen in other
									situations.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can influence the test results?</h2>
								<p>Certain medications and health conditions can affect the level of AFP. Pregnancy is
									one such condition that can significantly increase AFP levels, as the protein is
									produced in large amounts in the developing fetus.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with this test?</h2>
								<p>There is very little risk associated with drawing blood for this test. You may
									experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but
									these symptoms should go away quickly.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can I prepare for the test?</h2>
								<p>There's no special preparation required for an AFP test. However, you should inform
									your doctor about any medications you're taking as some could affect the test
									results.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> When will I receive the test results?</h2>
								<p>The turnaround time for serum AFP testing is typically 1-2 days. However, this can
									depend on the lab that is processing the test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can the AFP test be used for cancer screening?</h2>
								<p>The AFP test is not typically used for cancer screening in the general population due
									to its lack of specificity. It can, however, be used as part of a monitoring
									strategy for people who are at high risk for certain types of cancer, such as those
									with chronic liver disease.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can the AFP test detect cancer recurrence?</h2>
								<p>AFP is often used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for certain types of
									cancer and may also be used to detect recurrence. If levels drop in response to
									treatment and then start to rise again, it may indicate that the cancer has
									returned.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Are there any limitations to the AFP test?</h2>
								<p>The AFP test is not definitive—other tests are necessary to confirm a diagnosis. High
									levels of AFP can be seen in conditions other than cancer, such as cirrhosis or
									hepatitis. AFP levels can also vary among individuals, and not all people with
									cancers that elevate AFP will have elevated levels.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What other tests might be performed along with AFP in serum?
								</h2>
								<p>Other tests often performed in conjunction with serum AFP testing include liver
									function tests, imaging studies, and other tumor markers like CA 19-9 for pancreatic
									cancer or CEA for colorectal cancer.</p>
								<p>This information should be interpreted in the context of the patient's symptoms, medical
								history, and other test results. Always discuss these test results and any concerns with
								your healthcare provider.</p>
