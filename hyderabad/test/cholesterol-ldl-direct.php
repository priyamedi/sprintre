<p>The Cholesterol - LDL (Direct) test directly measures the amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. LDL cholesterol is often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, as high levels can lead to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.
