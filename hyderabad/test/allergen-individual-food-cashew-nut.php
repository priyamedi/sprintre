<div class="post-text">
<p>The <strong>Allergen, Individual - Food Cashew Nut</strong> test is designed to detect a specific type of immune response, specifically to cashew nuts. Cashews, like other tree nuts, are a common cause of food allergies in both children and adults. For some, this allergy can be mild, presenting <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms/"><b style="color:#2C53A5">symptoms</b></a> such as hives or <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms/indigestion"><b style="color:#2C53A5">stomach discomfort</b></a>. However, for others, it can result in a severe reaction, like anaphylaxis, which is a medical emergency.
 </p>
<p>This diagnostic test measures the levels of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in your bloodstream. When your body is exposed to an allergen, such as cashew protein, it may react by producing these antibodies as part of an immune response. This response can lead to a range of <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms/"><b style="color:#2C53A5">symptoms</b></a>, which constitute an allergic reaction.
