<div class="post-text">
<p>Haemophilia is an inherited genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to make blood clots, a process needed to stop bleeding. There are two main types of haemophilia: Haemophilia A, which is caused by a deficiency of clotting Factor VIII, and Haemophilia B, which is caused by a deficiency of clotting Factor IX. A Haemophilia Profile is used to diagnose these two types of haemophilia and determine their severity.
 </p>
<p>The profile includes tests for Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) with mixing studies, Factor VIII, and Factor IX. APTT is a screening test that measures the time it takes for blood to clot, while mixing studies are used to determine whether a prolonged APTT is due to a deficiency of certain clotting factors or the presence of an inhibitor. The tests for Factor VIII and Factor IX measure the levels of these specific clotting factors in the blood.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is a Haemophilia Profile?
 </h2>
	<p> A Haemophilia Profile is a set of tests used to diagnose and determine the severity of Haemophilia A and Haemophilia B.
 </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the Haemophilia Profile done? 
 </h2>
	<p>This test is performed when a patient presents with symptoms of a bleeding disorder such as easy bruising, prolonged bleeding, or bleeding into joints. It is also used to confirm a diagnosis of haemophilia and to differentiate between Haemophilia A and B.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does the Haemophilia Profile include? </h2>
<p>The profile includes tests for Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) with mixing studies, Factor VIII, and Factor IX.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is this test performed? </h2>
<p>The test is performed on a blood sample, which is drawn from a vein in your arm.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do the test results mean? </h2>
<p>A prolonged APTT with normal PT (another clotting test) suggests a clotting factor deficiency. If Factor VIII levels are low, it indicates Haemophilia A, while low Factor IX levels indicate Haemophilia B. The severity of haemophilia is determined by how much of the factor is missing or not functioning properly.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done? </h2>
<p>This test is typically performed when a patient presents with symptoms of a bleeding disorder or has a family history of haemophilia. The frequency of the test should be determined by your doctor based on your individual health condition.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the test results? </h2>
<p>Certain medications, such as blood thinners or anticoagulants, can affect the results of this test. It's important to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking before the test.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What type of doctor should I see if I have abnormal test results?</h2>
<p>If your test results are abnormal, you should consult with a hematologist, a doctor who specializes in blood disorders.</p>

<p>Understanding haemophilia and its implications is crucial for those diagnosed with this condition. With proper diagnosis using a Haemophilia Profile and appropriate treatment, individuals with haemophilia can lead healthy lives. If you or a loved one are experiencing symptoms of a bleeding disorder, it's important to seek medical attention promptly. The earlier the diagnosis, the better the chances are for effectively managing the condition.</p>
