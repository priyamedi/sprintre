								<p>Vitamin A, a fat-soluble vitamin, plays a crucial role in vision, growth, cell division, reproduction, and immunity. Vitamin A test measures the level of vitamin A in the blood to determine if there are deficiencies or excesses present. Deficiencies in vitamin A can lead to night blindness and other vision problems, skin issues, and a weakened immune system, while an excess can lead to nausea, irritability, anorexia, vomiting, blurry vision, headaches, hair loss, muscle pain, and many other symptoms.</p>
								<p>Vitamin A is present in foods such as dairy products, fish, and liver, while beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, is found in fruits and vegetables like carrots and spinach. Despite its presence in food, deficiencies can still occur due to a diet lacking vitamin A-rich food or problems with absorption in the digestive tract.</p>
