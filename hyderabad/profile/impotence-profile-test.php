<div class="post-text">
<p>The Impotence Profile Test is a comprehensive diagnostic test used to determine the levels of certain hormones in the blood that play a critical role in sexual health and reproduction. The hormones assessed in this test include Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Prolactin, Testosterone, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), and Free Androgen Index</p>
<p>This hormone profile helps in diagnosing the cause of impotence, also known as erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse. It also helps in determining hormonal imbalances that might lead to issues related to fertility and overall sexual health.</p>
