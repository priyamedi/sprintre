<div class="post-text">
<p>Mackerel is a popular type of fish consumed by people worldwide. For many, it is a delicious and nutritious option that can be included in a balanced diet. Mackerel is known for being rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have various health benefits. However, some individuals may have an allergy to mackerel, which is typically an immune response to the proteins found in the fish. The Allergen, Individual - Food Mackerel test helps in determining whether an individual is allergic to mackerel by measuring the level of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood. </p>
