								<p>The Allergen, Individual - Animal Parrot Feather Diagnostic Test is a valuable tool used to determine whether an individual has an allergic reaction to parrot feathers. This test measures the levels of specific antibodies in the blood, produced by the immune system in response to exposure to parrot feathers. This test can be particularly beneficial for people who often interact with parrots, such as pet owners, pet shop workers, bird breeders, or avian veterinarians.</p>
								<p>Allergies are the result of an overactive immune system response to substances that are usually harmless, like parrot feathers. When the body encounters an allergen, it reacts by producing antibodies against it. This reaction can cause symptoms that range from mild, such as itching or sneezing, to severe and potentially life-threatening.</p>
