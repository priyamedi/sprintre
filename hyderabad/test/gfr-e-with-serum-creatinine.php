<div class="post-text">
<p>Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It estimates how much blood passes through the glomeruli, the tiny filters in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood, each minute. GFR-e, or estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate, is calculated using a formula that takes into account the serum creatinine levels along with other factors such as age, gender, and body size. Serum creatinine is a waste product that's produced by your muscles and filtered out of your blood by the kidneys. When kidney function is not adequate, creatinine levels rise, which is why it is an important marker in assessing kidney health.</p>
<p>Testing for GFR-e is critical for those who have chronic kidney disease or are at risk of developing it. It helps doctors to stage the level of kidney disease and decide on the appropriate management or treatment. It is also used to monitor those who have been diagnosed with other conditions that could affect the kidneys, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the GFR-e test important?</h2>
<p>The GFR-e test is essential for assessing how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. It’s crucial
    for the diagnosis and management of kidney disease.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does serum creatinine mean?</h2>
<p>Serum creatinine is a waste product that comes from the normal wear and tear on muscles of the body. Healthy
    kidneys remove creatinine from your blood, but if kidney function is impaired, creatinine levels will rise.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is a normal GFR-e range?</h2>
<p>Generally, a GFR-e above 60 milliliters per minute (mL/min) is considered normal. A GFR-e below 60 mL/min suggests
    that the kidneys are not functioning at full capacity. The lower the GFR-e, the worse the kidney function.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I get a GFR-e test?</h2>
<p>The frequency of the GFR-e test depends on various factors including your age, health conditions, and risk factors
    for kidney disease. Your doctor will recommend how often you should get the test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I prevent my GFR-e from decreasing?</h2>
<p>While some factors like aging can’t be changed, maintaining a healthy lifestyle by exercising, eating a balanced
    diet, managing blood pressure and avoiding tobacco can help in preserving kidney function.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any symptoms of decreased GFR-e?</h2>
<p>Early stages of kidney disease may not show any symptoms. As kidney function worsens, symptoms such as fatigue,
    swollen ankles, frequent urination, and high blood pressure can develop.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What should I do if my GFR-e is low?</h2>
<p>If your GFR-e is low, it’s important to consult a doctor, preferably a nephrologist, who specializes in kidney
    care and treating kidney disease.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is GFR-e test only for those with kidney disease?</h2>
<p>While GFR-e is crucial in diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease, it’s also important for those who have
    conditions that increase the risk of kidney damage, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect GFR-e levels?</h2>
<p>Several factors can affect GFR-e levels including kidney diseases, certain medications, dehydration, and dietary
    protein intake.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the relationship between GFR-e and serum creatinine?</h2>
<p>GFR-e and serum creatinine are inversely related. When kidney function is normal, creatinine levels are low; as
    kidney function decreases, creatinine levels increase.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is there a treatment for improving GFR-e?</h2>
<p>Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the decreased GFR-e. Managing conditions like diabetes and high blood
    pressure are important. Lifestyle changes and medications can also help in some cases.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the GFR-e test performed?</h2>
<p>The GFR-e test is performed on a blood sample which is usually drawn from a vein in the arm.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with this test?</h2>
<p>There is very little risk associated with having blood drawn for the GFR-e test. You might experience slight pain
    or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can a person with a single kidney have a normal GFR-e?</h2>
<p>Yes, it’s possible for a person with a single kidney to have a normal GFR-e. The remaining kidney can compensate
    by increasing its filtration rate.</p>
<p>Taking care of your kidneys is an essential part of maintaining overall health. Regular
    monitoring of kidney function through GFR-e and serum creatinine levels is especially important for those at risk of
    kidney disease. If you have chronic kidney disease, are at risk of it, or have other risk factors such as diabetes,
    high blood pressure, or heart disease, it’s important to discuss with your doctor about how you can best monitor and
    protect your kidney health.</p>
