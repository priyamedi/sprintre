<p>Calcium is a crucial mineral found in the body that plays an essential role in various physiological
processes, including bone formation, nerve signal transmission, muscle contraction, and blood clotting.
While most of the body&#39;s calcium is stored in the bones and teeth, a small amount circulates in the
blood and can be excreted in the urine. A 24-hour urine calcium test measures the amount of calcium
that&#39;s excreted in the urine over a 24-hour period. </p>
<p>This test is usually ordered when a blood calcium test shows levels that are above or below the normal
range. It is a crucial test in the diagnosis and management of various conditions related to calcium
metabolism, such as hypercalcemia (excessive calcium levels), hypocalcemia (low calcium levels), kidney
stones, bone diseases, and disorders of the parathyroid gland. </p>
