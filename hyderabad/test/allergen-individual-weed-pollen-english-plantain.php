<div class="post-text">
<p>An Allergen, Individual - Weed Pollen English Plantain test is a specific type of allergy test designed to identify whether an individual is allergic to the pollen of the English Plantain, also known as Plantago lanceolata. This weed is common globally and is known to cause allergic reactions in certain susceptible individuals. </p>
<p>Allergies are the immune system's overreaction to specific substances that are generally harmless. These substances are called allergens. For some people, English Plantain pollen is an allergen. It triggers an immune response, leading to various symptoms such as sneezing, itching, nasal congestion, and, in severe cases, difficulty in breathing.
