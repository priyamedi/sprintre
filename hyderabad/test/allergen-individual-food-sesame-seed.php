<div class="post-text">
<p>Sesame seeds are derived from the sesame plant and are often used in various cuisines around the world. They are popular for their rich, nutty flavor and high nutritional content. However, for some individuals, consuming sesame seeds or products containing them can trigger an allergic reaction. The Allergen, Individual - Food Sesame Seed test helps to determine whether an individual has an allergy to sesame seeds.</p>
<p>This test analyzes the blood for specific antibodies that the body produces in response to proteins in sesame seeds. In individuals who are allergic to sesame seeds, the immune system erroneously identifies proteins in the seeds as harmful, resulting in an allergic reaction.
