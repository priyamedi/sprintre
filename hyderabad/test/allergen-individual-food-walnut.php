<div class="post-text">
<p>Walnuts are a type of nut that come from the tree species Juglans. They are highly nutritious and are often consumed raw, roasted, or used as ingredients in various dishes. Walnuts are known for their omega-3 fatty acids content, which is beneficial for heart health. However, some individuals have an allergy to walnuts. The Allergen, Individual - Food Walnut test is a diagnostic tool that identifies the presence of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood that are indicative of an allergy to walnuts.
 </p>
<p>Understanding if you have an allergy to walnuts is vital for your well-being. Being allergic means that your immune system, which normally fights infections, erroneously identifies proteins in walnuts as harmful. Your immune system then releases chemicals like histamines to counter this perceived threat, which results in an allergic reaction.
