<h1 class="test-h1">IHC - Final diagnosis panel with histopathology (upto 5 antibodies) </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) involves a method that provides information about the cellular distribution of proteins within a tissue sample. The process uses specific antibodies that bind to proteins, enabling pathologists to visually identify the presence, abundance, and location of specific proteins.
 </p>
<p>The IHC final diagnosis panel with histopathology uses up to five specific antibodies tailored to the patient's specific diagnostic needs. In combination with histopathology, which studies the microscopic structure of diseased tissues, it provides a detailed picture of the disease at the cellular level. This information is essential in diagnosing various diseases, including cancers, and guides therapeutic decisions.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the purpose of this test?  </h2>
	<p>The IHC final diagnosis panel aims to detect and locate specific proteins in a tissue sample to help diagnose disease. It can identify different types of cancer, inflammation, or infection in the body.
 </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is there any special preparation required for this test? 
 </h2>
	<p>No special preparation is required from the patient's side. The tissue sample needed for the test is usually taken by a healthcare professional.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the test performed? </h2>
<p>The test is performed on a tissue sample, which is usually obtained through biopsy. The tissue is then treated with specific antibodies and examined under a microscope.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does the test measure? </h2>
<p>The test measures the presence, location, and abundance of specific proteins in the tissue sample.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done?</h2>
<p>The frequency of this test depends on the healthcare provider's recommendations, which are based on the patient's medical history and current health condition.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
<p>Normal values can vary depending on the specific antibodies used. In general, normal tissues will show expected patterns of protein distribution, while abnormal or diseased tissues may show different patterns.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the results? </h2>
<p>Several factors can affect the results, including the quality of the tissue sample, the technique used for the test, and the specific antibodies used.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Who should be consulted in case of abnormal results?</h2>
<p>In case of abnormal results, a pathologist or the treating physician who ordered the test should be consulted.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is this test used only for diagnosing cancer? </h2>
<p>While this test is frequently used in diagnosing different types of cancers, it's also used for diagnosing other conditions such as autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is this test conclusive for diagnosis? </h2>
<p>While the results of this test provide valuable information, they should be interpreted in combination with other clinical and diagnostic findings for a conclusive diagnosis.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Does the test cause any discomfort or side effects? </h2>
<p>The discomfort associated with this test is usually related to the tissue sampling or biopsy procedure, not the IHC test itself.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long does it take to get the results?</h2>
<p>Typically, the turnaround time for results is 7 to 10 days. However, this may vary depending on the laboratory and the complexity of the analysis.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the results of this test guide treatment decisions?</h2>
<p>Yes, the results can guide treatment decisions, particularly in the case of cancers where the presence or absence of specific proteins can impact the choice of therapy.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test be performed on any tissue sample? </h2>
<p>Yes, this test can be performed on a wide variety of tissue samples. However, the choice of tissue depends on the suspected disease and the physician's discretion.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test replace other diagnostic tests? </h2>
<p>No, this test complements other diagnostic tests and provides additional information that can help make a more accurate diagnosis.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why are only up to five antibodies used in this test?</h2>
<p>The number of antibodies used depends on the suspected disease and the specific proteins associated with it. Using up to five antibodies allows for a thorough investigation without overloading the sample or complicating the results.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How reliable is this test? </h2>
<p>The reliability of this test is high, provided the sample collection and preparation are correctly done. However, like any test, there may be some false positives or false negatives, which is why the results are often used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests and clinical findings.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What happens if the results are inconclusive?</h2>
<p>If the results are inconclusive, your healthcare provider may decide to repeat the test using a different set of antibodies or recommend additional tests to help establish a diagnosis.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the test identify the stage of cancer? </h2>
<p>While the IHC test can help identify specific types of cancer and provide information on the characteristics of the cancer cells, it's not typically used to determine the stage of cancer. Other tests and examinations are needed for staging.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What modifiable factors can affect the test results?</h2>
<p>Since the test is performed on a tissue sample, lifestyle factors that the patient can modify don't typically affect the test results. However, the accuracy of the test can be influenced by the quality of the tissue sample and the techniques used in the lab.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What non-modifiable factors can affect the test results?</h2>
<p>Non-modifiable factors include the characteristics of the disease being tested for and the individual's genetic makeup, which can affect the presence and distribution of specific proteins.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What other tests may be performed with this one? </h2>
<p>Other tests that may be performed along with this test depend on the suspected condition but may include other histopathological tests, blood tests, or imaging studies.</p>

<p>The ability to identify the presence and location of specific proteins in tissue samples makes the IHC final diagnosis panel with histopathology a powerful diagnostic tool. It provides physicians with information at a cellular level, aiding them in making an accurate diagnosis and guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, if your doctor has recommended this test, rest assured that it can provide crucial insights into your health and help guide your healthcare journey.</p>
