						<div class="post-text">
							<p>Lamb, a common type of red meat, is a staple in many diets worldwide. However, for some,
								consuming lamb can trigger allergic reactions due to an immune response against proteins
								present in lamb. These reactions can range from mild to severe and, in some cases, can
								be life-threatening. That's where the Allergen, Individual - Food Lamb test comes into
								play.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Allergen, Individual - Food Lamb test is a diagnostic test used to identify if an
								individual has an allergy to lamb. This test works by identifying the presence of
								specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood that react to proteins found in
								lamb. If these antibodies are detected in high levels, it suggests an allergy to lamb.
