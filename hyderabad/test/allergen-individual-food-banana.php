<div class="post-text">
<p>Allergen, Individual - Food Banana test is used to assess if you're allergic to bananas. This test determines the amount of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in your blood that react to banana proteins. A higher amount of these antibodies may suggest an allergy to bananas.</p>

<p>Bananas are generally safe and healthy fruit, offering numerous health benefits. They are rich in fiber, antioxidants, and several essential nutrients. However, a small percentage of people are allergic to bananas. When these individuals eat a banana, their immune system reacts as though it was harmful, resulting in an allergic reaction.</p>
