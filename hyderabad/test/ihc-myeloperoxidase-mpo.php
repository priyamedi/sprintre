<div class="post-text">
<p><strong>Myeloperoxidase (MPO)</strong> is an enzyme found in certain types of white blood cells, namely neutrophils and monocytes. Its primary function is to help these cells kill bacteria and other pathogens. The IHC - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) test uses immunohistochemistry, a lab technique that uses antibodies to detect the presence of specific proteins, like MPO, in a tissue sample. This test can be instrumental in diagnosing diseases related to the immune system, such as certain types of leukemia and vasculitis.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the IHC - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) test important?</h2>
<p>The <strong>IHC - MPO test</strong> is critical for diagnosing specific conditions like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
    granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which were previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis. An increased MPO level is
    typically seen in AML, while a decrease may suggest a diagnosis of vasculitis.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Do I need to fast before the IHC - MPO test?</h2>
<p>No, you do not need to fast before the IHC - MPO test. You can continue with your regular diet and daily activities
    unless your doctor suggests otherwise.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I get this test?</h2>
<p>The frequency of this test depends on your doctor's recommendations. It is typically ordered when you have <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms"><b style="color:#2C53A5">symptoms</b></a>
    suggestive of the conditions mentioned earlier or when your doctor wants to monitor the effectiveness of your
    treatment.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do the results of the IHC - MPO test mean?</h2>
<p>The <strong>IHC - MPO test</strong> results can help determine whether MPO is present in your tissue samples and to what extent. High
    levels are usually indicative of conditions like AML, while low levels can point towards vasculitis.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Who should interpret the results of the IHC - MPO test?</h2>
<p>A pathologist usually interprets the results of the IHC - MPO test. If the results are abnormal, your doctor will
    explain what this means and discuss the next steps, which may include further tests or treatments.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for the IHC - MPO test?</h2>
<p>The normal values for the IHC - MPO test can vary. Typically, the presence of MPO in cells is considered normal, but
    its overexpression may suggest a disease.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any precautions I should take before or after the test?</h2>
<p>There are no specific precautions to take before or after the IHC - MPO test. It's a good idea to discuss any
    medications you are taking with your doctor, as some drugs may influence the test results.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any factors that can affect the levels of MPO?</h2>
<p>Several factors can affect MPO levels, including infections, inflammatory conditions, and certain medications. Both
    modifiable and non-modifiable factors can influence MPO levels.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What doctor should I consult if my test results are abnormal?</h2>
<p>If your test results are abnormal, you should consult a hematologist or rheumatologist, depending on the underlying
    condition suggested by the results.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test diagnose other conditions?</h2>
<p>Yes, the <strong>IHC - MPO test</strong> can help diagnose a range of conditions where MPO plays a role. These conditions include, but
    are not limited to, acute myeloid leukemia, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and certain infections.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What happens if my MPO levels are high?</h2>
<p>High levels of MPO are often indicative of conditions like acute myeloid leukemia. If your MPO levels are high, your
    doctor will likely recommend further testing and discuss potential treatment options with you.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is the IHC - MPO test painful?</h2>
<p>The pain associated with the IHC - MPO test depends on the method used to collect the tissue sample. Some methods may
    cause mild discomfort, but any pain should be temporary.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the tissue sample for the IHC - MPO test collected?</h2>
<p>The collection method for the IHC - MPO test depends on the type of tissue being sampled. Common methods include
    needle biopsies, surgical biopsies, or bone marrow aspirations.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I do this test at home?</h2>
<p>No, the IHC - MPO test cannot be done at home. It requires a tissue sample collected in a clinical setting, and the
    test itself is performed in a laboratory by trained professionals.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long does it take to get the results of the IHC - MPO test?</h2>
<p>The turn-around-time for the IHC - MPO test varies but is typically 2-3 days. Your doctor will notify you when the
    results are available.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the potential complications of this test?</h2>
<p>The IHC - MPO test itself does not typically carry significant risks or complications, as it's performed on a tissue
    sample collected from your body. However, the method used to collect that tissue sample may have associated risks.
    For example, a needle biopsy may cause discomfort or bruising, and, in rare cases, infection.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the results of the IHC - MPO test vary depending on the laboratory?</h2>
<p>Yes, results can vary slightly from lab to lab. It's essential to have the test done in a reliable and accredited
    laboratory to ensure accuracy. Also, it's recommended to have all follow-up tests done at the same laboratory to
    maintain consistency in reporting and interpretation.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can I prepare for the IHC - MPO test?</h2>
<p>There are no specific preparations required for this test. However, it is always a good idea to inform your
    healthcare provider about any medications or supplements you are taking, as some substances might interfere with the
    results.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can other medical conditions affect the IHC - MPO test results?</h2>
<p>Yes, several medical conditions can affect the <strong>IHC - MPO test</strong> results, such as inflammation or infections, which
    might increase MPO levels. Your doctor will interpret your results, taking into consideration your overall health
    condition and medical history.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What should I do after I get my test results?</h2>
<p>After receiving your test results, it is recommended to discuss them with your doctor. They can provide insights into
    what the results mean for your health condition and guide you about the next steps, which might include additional
    testing, medication changes, or a referral to a specialist.</p>
<p>Remember, understanding your health and the medical tests you undergo is crucial for making
    informed decisions. If you have any doubts or concerns, never hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider.
