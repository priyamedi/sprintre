						<div class="post-text">
							<p> Yogurt is a popular dairy product made by fermenting milk with the help of bacterial
								cultures. It is known for its probiotic properties and is often consumed for its
								potential health benefits including aiding digestion and supporting the immune system.
								However, some individuals might have an adverse reaction to consuming yogurt. The
								Allergen, Individual - Food Yogurt test is designed to diagnose a yogurt allergy by
								detecting the presence of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood.
							</p>
							<p>
								A yogurt allergy is an immune system's reaction to proteins present in yogurt, mainly
								casein and whey. The immune system of an allergic person considers these proteins as
								harmful substances and mounts an immune response, which results in allergic symptoms.
