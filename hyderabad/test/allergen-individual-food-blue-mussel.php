<div class="post-text">
<p>Blue mussels are a type of shellfish that are commonly consumed worldwide. However, like many other seafood, they can cause allergic reactions in some individuals. Allergic reactions are essentially your body's immune system overreacting to substances that it wrongly perceives as harmful. In the case of blue mussels, your body can misinterpret the proteins in them as harmful invaders, leading to an allergic response.</p>

<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Blue Mussel test is designed to detect an allergy to blue mussels. This diagnostic test measures the presence and level of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to blue mussel proteins in the blood. The presence of these antibodies indicates an allergic response from the immune system to the ingestion of blue mussels.</p>
