<div class="post-text">
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Chick Pea test is a vital diagnostic investigation that checks for allergic reactions to chickpeas (garbanzo beans). The test measures the presence of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood that respond to proteins present in chickpeas. An allergic reaction is triggered when the body's immune system erroneously identifies proteins in chickpeas as harmful substances, leading to the production of IgE antibodies.
 </p>
<p>Chickpea allergies, though not very common, can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from mild to severe. This test is particularly beneficial in confirming or ruling out a suspected chickpea allergy. The test becomes necessary when an individual exhibits symptoms such as skin rashes, itching, swelling, or digestive issues after consuming chickpeas or products containing chickpeas.
