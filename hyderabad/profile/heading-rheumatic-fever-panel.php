<div class="post-text">
<p><strong>Rheumatic fever</strong> is a systemic inflammatory disease that can develop as a delayed reaction to a throat
infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A streptococcus (GAS). If untreated, it
can lead to serious conditions such as rheumatic heart disease. The <strong>Rheumatic Fever Panel</strong> includes
several tests such as <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/our-services/laboratory/hematology/"><b style="color:#2C53A5">Complete Blood Count (CBC)</b></a>
, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR),
</p>
<p> Antistreptolysin O (ASO), C-reactive protein (CRP), and a throat swab for culture and sensitivity. These
tests together help in the diagnosis and management of rheumatic fever.
The <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/our-services/laboratory/hematology/"><b style="color:#2C53A5">CBC</b></a>
 evaluates the different components of blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and
platelets. ESR and CRP are markers of inflammation in the body. An ASO test measures antibodies
against streptolysin O, a toxin produced by group A strep. If you've had a recent strep <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms/frequent-infections"><b style="color:#2C53A5">infection</b></a>, levels of
ASO in your blood will be higher. The throat swab culture is performed to detect the presence of GAS,
which could indicate a recent or current infection. </p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Why is a Rheumatic Fever Panel necessary?</h2>
	<p>
The panel is necessary to identify if a patient is suffering from <strong>rheumatic fever</strong>, a condition that usually
follows a streptococcal throat infection and can lead to severe complications like heart disease if not
treated promptly.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the sample collected for the panel?</h2>
<p>
A blood sample is drawn from a vein in the arm for the <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/our-services/laboratory/hematology/"><b style="color:#2C53A5">blood tests</b></a>, and a swab is taken from the throat
for the culture.</p>
	<!--section achieved-->

	<!--//section achieved-->
	
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How should I prepare for this test?</h2>
<p>
No special preparation is necessary for this test. However, it's important to inform your healthcare
provider about any medications or supplements you are currently taking.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What does an elevated ASO level indicate?</h2>
<p>
An elevated ASO level in your blood indicates a recent or past <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms/frequent-infections"><b style="color:#2C53A5">infection</b></a>
 with group A Streptococcus, the
bacteria responsible for conditions like strep throat and rheumatic fever.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What does a high ESR or CRP level suggest?</h2>
<p>
Both ESR and CRP are markers of inflammation in the body. High levels of these markers may indicate
ongoing inflammation, which could be due to <strong>rheumatic fever</strong> or other inflammatory conditions.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Are there any risks associated with this test?</h2>
<p>
The test involves a routine blood draw and throat swab, which are generally safe procedures. However,
some people may experience mild pain or bruising at the blood draw site.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How long will it take to get the results of the test?</h2>
<p>
The turnaround time for the results can vary, but generally, it takes between 2-5 days.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can I eat and drink normally before the test?</h2>
<p>
Yes, you can eat and drink normally before the test unless your healthcare provider instructs otherwise.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How is rheumatic fever treated?</h2>
<p>
<strong>Rheumatic fever</strong> is usually treated with antibiotics to eliminate any remaining strep bacteria, along with
anti-inflammatory treatments to reduce inflammation and pain. In some cases, long-term preventive
treatment with antibiotics may be necessary to prevent recurrence.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the role of the throat swab culture in this panel?</h2>
<p>
The throat swab culture helps in identifying the presence of group A streptococcus bacteria in the
throat, which is responsible for conditions like strep throat and can trigger rheumatic fever.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can rheumatic fever recur?</h2>
<p>
Yes, rheumatic fever can recur, especially if strep throat infections are not adequately treated.
Recurrences can cause further damage to the heart.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What complications can arise from rheumatic fever?</h2>
<p>
If left untreated, <strong>rheumatic fever</strong> can lead to serious complications, including permanent damage to the
heart (rheumatic heart disease), damage to other organs such as the brain and joints, and in severe
cases, heart failure.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Is rheumatic fever contagious?</h2>
<p>
Rheumatic fever itself is not contagious, but the strep throat infection that often precedes it is
contagious.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can rheumatic fever be prevented?</h2>
<p>
The best prevention for <strong>rheumatic fever</strong> is to treat strep throat or scarlet fever promptly with antibiotics
to prevent the progression of the <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms/frequent-infections"><b style="color:#2C53A5">infection.</b></a>
</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Who is at risk for developing rheumatic fever?</h2>
<p>
Individuals who have had a recent strep throat infection, especially children between the ages of 5 and
15, are at higher risk. Factors such as genetics, environmental conditions, and access to healthcare can
also influence the risk.</p>
