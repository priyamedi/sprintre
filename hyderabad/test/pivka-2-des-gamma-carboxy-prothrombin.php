						<p>The PIVKA-2 (Des-gamma Carboxy Prothrombin) test is a blood test that measures the levels of PIVKA-2, also known as Des-gamma Carboxy Prothrombin (DCP), in your blood. PIVKA-2 is a protein that is produced when the liver is not functioning properly, particularly in the presence of vitamin K deficiency.</p>
						<p>This test is particularly important in the context of liver disease and liver cancer. Elevated levels of PIVKA-2 can be an indicator of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer, and can also be associated with worsening liver function in people with liver disease.</p>
