<h1 class="test-h1">IHC - CD79a</h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>The Immunohistochemistry - CD79a (IHC - CD79a) test is a diagnostic procedure that uses the principle of immunohistochemistry to identify the presence of the CD79a protein in tissue samples. This protein is typically found on the surface of B cells, which are a type of white blood cell involved in the immune response.</p>
<p>In medical diagnostics, the CD79a protein is often used as a marker for B-cell lineage, meaning it can help distinguish B-cell lymphomas and leukemias from other types of cancers. CD79a is expressed throughout the B-cell maturation process, making it a valuable diagnostic tool.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the IHC - CD79a test used for?</h2>
<p>The IHC - CD79a test is primarily used to aid in the diagnosis of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias, as the CD79a
    protein is expressed on the surface of B cells.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the IHC - CD79a test performed?</h2>
<p>The test is performed on a tissue biopsy sample, usually obtained through a minimally invasive procedure. The sample
    is then stained with a specific antibody that binds to the CD79a protein. The binding is then visualized under a
    microscope, confirming the presence and location of the protein.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is the IHC - CD79a test painful?</h2>
<p>The pain experienced during the biopsy procedure varies depending on the site from where the tissue sample is
    obtained. Local or general anesthesia is often used to minimize discomfort.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does a positive IHC - CD79a test mean?</h2>
<p>A positive result means that the CD79a protein is present in the tissue sample, which is indicative of a B-cell
    lymphoma or leukemia.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does a negative IHC - CD79a test mean?</h2>
<p>A negative result means that the CD79a protein was not detected in the tissue sample. This could indicate that the
    patient does not have a B-cell lymphoma or leukemia, or the disease might be in a stage where the protein is not
    expressed.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the IHC - CD79a test be used for monitoring treatment progress?</h2>
<p>Yes, the IHC - CD79a test may be used to monitor the response to treatment in certain B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.
    Changes in CD79a expression can be indicative of the effectiveness of the treatment.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the risks associated with the IHC - CD79a test?</h2>
<p>The primary risk associated with this test is related to the biopsy procedure. This can include pain, infection, and
    bleeding at the biopsy site.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any limitations to the IHC - CD79a test?</h2>
<p>Yes, while the IHC - CD79a test is highly specific for B-cells, not all B-cell lymphomas and leukemias will express
    CD79a. Therefore, a negative result does not definitively rule out these conditions.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I eat or drink before the IHC - CD79a test?</h2>
<p>There are typically no dietary restrictions before the test, but follow any specific instructions given by your
    healthcare provider.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long does it take to get the results of the IHC - CD79a test?</h2>
<p>The results are typically available within 2 to 4 days, but this can vary depending on the laboratory.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is the IHC - CD79a test covered by insurance?</h2>
<p>Coverage for the IHC - CD79a test depends on your insurance plan. It's recommended to check with your insurance
    provider before undergoing the test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the normal range for the IHC - CD79a test?</h2>
<p>In a normal tissue sample, B-cells expressing CD79a should be present. However, the number and distribution of these
    cells depend on the specific tissue and the individual's health status.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What other tests might be performed along with the IHC - CD79a test?</h2>
<p>Other tests that might be performed along with the IHC - CD79a test include other immunohistochemistry tests for
    different cell markers, genetic tests, and additional pathology tests to help establish a diagnosis.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can medications affect the result of the IHC - CD79a test?</h2>
<p>Certain medications can affect the immune system and may alter the distribution of B-cells in tissue samples. It's
    important to inform your healthcare provider of any medications you are taking.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Who should get the IHC - CD79a test?</h2>
<p>This test is often ordered by a healthcare provider for patients with suspected B-cell lymphomas or leukemias. If you
    have symptoms suggestive of these conditions, your doctor might recommend this test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What kind of tissue sample is required for the IHC - CD79a test?</h2>
<p>The IHC - CD79a test is typically performed on a tissue sample obtained through a biopsy. The type of biopsy (needle,
    core, or surgical) depends on the suspected location of the disease.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do I need to do after the IHC - CD79a test?</h2>
<p>After the biopsy procedure, you need to follow your healthcare provider's instructions for wound care to prevent
    infection and promote healing. It is also important to look out for any potential complications such as excessive
    bleeding, fever, or severe pain.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can influence the result of the IHC - CD79a test?</h2>
<p>Factors that can influence the results of the IHC - CD79a test include the quality of the tissue sample, the stage of
    the disease, the individual's overall health, and the individual's use of certain medications.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the IHC - CD79a test be performed on children?</h2>
<p>Yes, the IHC - CD79a test can be performed on children if there is a clinical suspicion of B-cell lymphoma or
    leukemia. The decision to test a child is made by the healthcare provider based on the child's symptoms, clinical
    history, and physical examination findings.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there alternatives to the IHC - CD79a test for diagnosing B-cell lymphomas or
    leukemias?</h2>
<p>Yes, other tests such as flow cytometry, cytogenetic analysis, or molecular genetic tests can also be used to
    diagnose B-cell lymphomas or leukemias. However, each test has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice of
    test depends on the individual patient's situation.</p>
