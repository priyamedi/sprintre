<div class="post-text">
<p>The Lipase - Fluid Test is a diagnostic procedure that measures the levels of the enzyme lipase in a fluid sample, typically from the abdominal cavity. Lipase is an enzyme that helps in the digestion of fats. The test is often used to diagnose and monitor conditions such as pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), infections in the abdomen, or other disorders that might affect the digestive system.</p>
