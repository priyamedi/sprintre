<div class="post-text">
<p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) - KI67 (MIB-1) is a test that is frequently used in the field of pathology to
evaluate the proliferation rate of cells in human tissues. The KI67 protein is a cellular marker for
proliferation. It is present during all active phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and mitosis), but is absent
from resting cells (G0), making it an excellent marker to determine the growth fraction of a given cell
population.
</p>
<p>The MIB-1 clone of the Ki67 antibody is commonly used in clinical practice because it can be used on
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, which is the most common form of tissue preservation. The
Ki67 protein was first identified by the monoclonal antibody Ki67, which was generated by immunizing
mice with nuclei of the Hodgkin lymphoma cell line L428. The name Ki67 is derived from the city of its
first description (Kiel, Germany) and the number of the original clone in the 96-well plate.  </p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Why is the IHC - KI67 (MIB-1) test done?</h2>
	<p>
The test is often used in research and diagnostic settings to understand how rapidly cells are dividing in
a tissue sample. This can provide valuable information for diagnosing and grading cancers, as tumors
with higher Ki67 levels are often more aggressive. </p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How is the IHC - KI67 (MIB-1) test performed?</h2>
<p>
The test is performed on a tissue sample, which is fixed on a slide and treated with the Ki67 antibody.
The antibody binds to the Ki67 protein in the cell nuclei, and the bound antibody is then visualized using
a microscope. </p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Do I need to fast before this test?</h2>
<p>
No fasting is necessary for this test. </p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What do the results mean?</h2>
<p>
In general, a high level of Ki67 expression (many cells staining positive for Ki67) indicates a high rate of
cell division. This can be associated with aggressive tumor behavior in many types of cancer. </p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What factors could affect the results of the IHC - KI67 (MIB-1) test?</h2>
<p>
Technical issues such as sample handling, fixation, and processing can potentially affect the results.
Additionally, the interpretation of the results requires expertise and can be somewhat subjective. </p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How is the sample collected for the test?</h2>
<p>
A tissue sample is usually obtained through a biopsy, in which a small piece of tissue is removed from
the body for examination. </p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done?</h2>
<p>
This test is typically only done when needed for diagnosing or grading a tumor. It's not a routine
screening test. </p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can the results of this test predict the prognosis of cancer?</h2>
<p>
Yes, studies have shown that high Ki67 levels can be associated with a worse prognosis in many types of
cancer. However, the exact implications can depend on the type and stage of cancer. </p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Who can interpret the results of this test?</h2>
<p>
The results of this test should be interpreted by a pathologist, a doctor who specializes in diagnosing
diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope. </p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the normal value of Ki67 in tissues?</h2>
<p>
In normal tissues, only a small percentage of cells would be expected to be in the active phases of the
cell cycle at any given time. Therefore, Ki67 expression would typically be low. However, the exact
"normal" level can depend on the specific tissue and the individual's age and health status. </p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can this test be used for all types of cancer?</h2>
<p>
The Ki67 protein is expressed in proliferating cells of all types, so the test can theoretically be used for all
types of cancer. However, the usefulness and interpretation of the results can vary depending on the
type of cancer. </p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Are there any risks associated with this test?</h2>
<p>
The risks associated with the IHC - KI67 (MIB-1) test are mainly related to the biopsy procedure used to
obtain the tissue sample, which can include pain, infection, and bleeding. The test itself does not pose
any additional risks. </p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Is the IHC - KI67 (MIB-1) test the same as a biopsy?</h2>
<p>
No, a biopsy refers to the procedure of taking a sample of tissue from the body for examination. The IHC
- KI67 (MIB-1) test is a specific test that can be done on the tissue obtained from a biopsy. </p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the modifiable factors that can affect the KI67 levels?</h2>
<p>
There are no known modifiable factors (such as diet or lifestyle changes) that can affect Ki67 levels. Ki67
is a reflection of the cell's inherent growth rate. </p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What doctor should I consult if my test results are abnormal?</h2>
<p>
If your test results are abnormal, you should consult with your healthcare provider who ordered the
test, typically this could be your oncologist or pathologist. They can interpret your results in the context
of your overall health and disease status and guide further management. </p>
<p>In the complex world of cancer diagnosis and treatment, the IHC - KI67 (MIB-1) test serves as an
essential tool that helps pathologists and oncologists understand the nature of a tumor. An elevated
Ki67 index often indicates a higher rate of tumor cell proliferation, which may suggest a more aggressive
disease course. However, it is essential to understand that Ki67 is just one piece of the puzzle. The test's
results must be considered in conjunction with other clinical, histological, and laboratory findings to
establish an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment plan. As with any test or procedure, it's crucial
to discuss any questions or concerns you may have with your healthcare provider.
