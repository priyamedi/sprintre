<p>Culture and Sensitivity - Aerobic [Blood] is an essential diagnostic test used in identifying bacteria or
fungi in the blood. When bacteria or fungi enter the bloodstream, it can cause a severe systemic
infection known as bloodstream infection or sepsis. Early detection and identification are crucial for
appropriate treatment, as bloodstream infections can be life-threatening. </p>
<p>The culture part of the test involves taking a blood sample and putting it in a culture medium that
encourages the growth of bacteria or fungi. The sensitivity portion involves exposing the cultured
bacteria to various antibiotics to determine which are most effective in treating the infection. Knowing
the most effective antibiotic to use is especially important when dealing with antibiotic-resistant
bacteria.</p>
