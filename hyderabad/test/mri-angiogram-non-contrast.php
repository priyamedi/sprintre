							<p>An MRI Angiogram Non-Contrast is a non-invasive medical imaging technique used to
								visualize and evaluate the blood vessels in various parts of the body. Unlike
								traditional angiograms, this procedure does not use a contrast dye and relies solely on
								powerful magnets and radio waves to produce detailed images.
							</p>
							<p>
								Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the field of medical imaging. Among
								its applications, angiograms are particularly significant in the study of blood vessels.
								MRI angiogram non-contrast is especially useful for individuals who are allergic to
								contrast dyes or have kidney issues that make the use of contrast hazardous.This test
								helps in assessing the blood vessels and detecting any abnormalities such as aneurysms,
								blockages, or malformations. Being a non-contrast study, it is safer for patients who
								are at risk of adverse reactions to contrast agents.
							</p>
							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Specific Instructions:</h2>
							<ul>

								<li>
									<p> <strong>Fasting : </strong> Generally, no fasting is required. However, follow
										the instructions given by your doctor if there are any specific guidelines.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> <strong>Allergies : </strong> As this procedure does not use contrast agents,
										allergies are usually not a concern. However, informing your doctor about your
										general health history is always a good practice.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> <strong>Medications : </strong> Usually, you can continue to take your regular
										medications. If there are any exceptions, your doctor will inform you.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> <strong>Clothing : </strong> It is advisable to wear comfortable clothing. Avoid
										clothing with metal zippers, buttons, or underwire.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> <strong>Metal Objects : </strong> Remove all metal objects, including jewelry and
										piercings, as these can interfere with the MRI machine.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>


							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the process of getting the test done?</h2>
							<p>On the day of the test, you will be asked to change into a hospital gown and remove all
								metal objects. You will then lie down on an examination table that will slide into the
								MRI machine. You need to remain very still during the procedure, which usually takes 30
								minutes to an hour. The machine may make loud noises, but this is normal.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the importance of getting this test done?</h2>
							<p>An MRI angiogram non-contrast is vital for evaluating the condition of blood vessels.
								It's used to identify vascular diseases and is critical in the planning and assessment
								of surgical interventions.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the indications for this test?</h2>
							<p>This test is indicated for evaluating blood vessels throughout the body. It's used to
								assess conditions like aneurysms, blockages, vascular malformations, and to evaluate
								blood flow.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required for this test?</h2>
							<p>Usually, fasting is not required for this test. However, it's always good to check with
								your doctor for any specific instructions.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What information does this test provide?</h2>
							<p>The MRI angiogram non-contrast provides detailed images of blood vessels, enabling the
								identification of abnormalities like blockages or aneurysms. It is especially useful in
								cases where the use of contrast is contraindicated.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done?</h2>
							<p>The frequency of this test is dependent on the medical condition being monitored and the
								doctor’s recommendations.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should be taken?</h2>
							<p>Make sure to inform the medical staff about any implants, such as pacemakers, as these
								may interfere with the MRI. Stay still throughout the procedure to ensure the clarity of
								images.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
							<p>Normal values would show clear blood vessels without any blockages or abnormalities.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors affect the values of this test?</h2>
							<p>The quality of the images can be affected by body movement during the test and the
								presence of metal implants.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should be consulted in case of abnormal findings?</h2>
							<p>In case of abnormal findings, the patient should consult with a vascular surgeon or the
								doctor who recommended the test for further evaluation and management.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with this test?</h2>
							<p>The test is considered to be low-risk. However, the powerful magnets can affect metal
								implants, so it's essential to disclose any implants or metal in your body.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What happens after the test?</h2>
							<p>After the test, you can usually go home or return to your normal activities unless your
								doctor tells you otherwise. The images will be reviewed by a radiologist and the results
								will be sent to your doctor.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long does it take to get the results?</h2>
							<p>Typically, results are available within a few days, but this can vary.</p>
							<p>An MRI Angiogram Non-Contrast is an important diagnostic tool that allows for the safe
								and detailed evaluation of blood vessels. It's crucial for patients to follow the
								instructions given by the medical staff and to provide a comprehensive medical history
								to ensure the test is conducted safely and efficiently. The information gained from this
								test is invaluable in diagnosing and managing various vascular conditions.</p>
