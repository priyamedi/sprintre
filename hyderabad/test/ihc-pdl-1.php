<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the IHC PDL-1 (SP263-FDA approved clone) test?</h2>
<p>
The IHC PDL-1 (SP263-FDA approved clone) test is a pathology test that identifies the presence of
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in a tissue sample. The expression of PD-L1 can greatly impact the
treatment strategy for diseases such as lung cancer and melanoma.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How is the IHC PDL-1 (SP263-FDA approved clone) test performed?</h2>
<p>
This test is performed on a tissue biopsy sample. The sample is treated with a specific antibody, SP263,
which binds to PD-L1 if it is present in the tissue. This interaction can be visualized under a microscope.</p>
