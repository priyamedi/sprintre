<div class="post-text">
<p>Pumpkin is a popular ingredient in many dishes and is particularly prominent in autumn recipes and holiday meals. Pumpkins are known for their nutritional value, as they are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. However, some individuals may develop an allergic reaction to pumpkins or pumpkin seeds. This allergy is generally due to the body's immune system mistakenly identifying certain proteins in pumpkins as harmful.</p>
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Pumpkin test is designed to help in the diagnosis of pumpkin allergy. It detects the presence of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood that are produced in response to the proteins found in pumpkins.</p>
