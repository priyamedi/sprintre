<div class="post-text">
<p>Cardamom, known as the "queen of spices," is a staple in many global cuisines. Beyond its culinary use, it is also known for its medicinal properties, such as improving digestion and stimulating metabolism. However, in some individuals, consumption of cardamom can trigger an allergic reaction, which is where the Allergen, Individual - Food Cardamom test becomes necessary.</p>
<p>The test determines whether an individual has an allergy to cardamom. It does this by identifying specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood, which the immune system produces in response to perceived threats like allergens.</p>
