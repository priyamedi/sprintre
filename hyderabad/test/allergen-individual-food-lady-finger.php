						<div class="post-text">
							<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Lady Finger test is a specific type of blood test used to
								identify if a person has an allergic reaction to lady finger, also known as okra.
								Although less common compared to other food allergies, an okra allergy can still cause
								significant discomfort to an individual.
							</p>
							<p>
								This test is designed to identify specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the
								blood that react to lady finger. When the immune system perceives a foreign substance as
								harmful, it produces IgE antibodies. In the case of a lady finger allergy, these
								antibodies react to the proteins present in lady finger, leading to an allergic
								response.
