<div class="post-text">
<p>Soybeans are a staple food in many diets around the world. They are extremely nutritious and are a great source of protein, especially for those who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet. However, in some individuals, consumption of soybeans or products containing soy can lead to an allergic reaction. The immune system mistakenly identifies certain proteins in the soybean as harmful and launches an attack. This is why the Allergen, Individual - Food Soybean test is so significant.</p>
<p>The test is performed using a blood sample and is aimed at detecting the presence of antibodies produced in response to soy proteins. If the test returns a positive result, it indicates that the individual has a soy allergy and should exercise caution in consuming soy products.</p>
