							<p>Protein plays a key role in virtually all biological processes and amino acids, the
								building blocks of proteins, are essential for growth and repair of body tissues. They
								function as enzymes, in membranes, as transport carriers, and in some cases as hormones.
								The body contains large amounts of protein, most of it in skeletal muscle. The serum
								total protein test measures the total amount of two classes of proteins found in the
								fluid portion of your blood: albumin and globulin. Proteins are important parts of all
								cells and tissues. For example, albumin helps prevent fluid from leaking out of blood
								vessels. Globulins are a group of proteins that include enzymes and antibodies. </p>
