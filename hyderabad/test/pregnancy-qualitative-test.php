<div class="post-text">
<p>The Pregnancy Test (Qualitative) is a common diagnostic method used to determine if a woman is pregnant. It measures the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone produced by the placenta after the embryo attaches to the uterine lining. This test can be conducted using a blood or urine sample. A qualitative pregnancy test only provides a positive or negative result.</p>

<p>Typically, hCG can be detected as early as 10 days after conception, but this can vary between individuals and pregnancies. A positive result confirms pregnancy, while a negative result suggests that the individual is not pregnant. However, it's important to note that many factors can influence the results, and all outcomes should be discussed with a healthcare provider for accurate interpretation.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does this test measure?</h2>
<p>This test measures the presence of hCG, a hormone produced during pregnancy.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should I get this test?</h2>
<p>This test is usually done if you've missed your period and suspect that you might be pregnant.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done?</h2>
<p>The test is performed as needed, usually when pregnancy is suspected.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
<p>In a non-pregnant individual, hCG levels are typically undetectable. A positive result indicates the presence of hCG,
    suggesting pregnancy.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should I take for this test?</h2>
<p>There are no specific precautions for this test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the test results?</h2>

    consult your primary care physician or an obstetrician/gynecologist.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test determine how far along I am in my pregnancy?</h2>

    information about the gestational age.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is there a cure for conditions caused by abnormal hCG levels?</h2>
<p>Abnormal hCG levels can indicate conditions like ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. While these conditions cannot be
    "cured," appropriate medical intervention can manage them.</p>
