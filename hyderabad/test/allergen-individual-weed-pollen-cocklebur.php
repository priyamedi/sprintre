<div class="post-text">
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Weed Pollen Cocklebur test is an effective diagnostic tool used to determine if an individual is allergic to the pollen of Cocklebur, a type of weed that is common in many regions worldwide. It's worth mentioning that Cocklebur pollen is a well-known trigger for seasonal allergies, also known as hay fever, among susceptible individuals.
 </p>
<p>Allergies arise when our immune system overreacts to substances that are usually harmless, such as pollen, dust, or certain foods. In the case of Cocklebur pollen, the allergic individual's immune system identifies this pollen as a threat, triggering a response that leads to symptoms like sneezing, itching, congestion, and in some severe cases, respiratory distress.
