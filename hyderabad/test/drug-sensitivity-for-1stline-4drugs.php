								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is this test important?</h2>
								<p>The AFB/TB - Drug Sensitivity for 1st Line 4 Drugs (SIREP) test plays a critical role in the management of tuberculosis. The test helps determine whether the Mycobacterium tuberculosis is sensitive or resistant to the four first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. This information is essential in designing an effective treatment regimen for patients with tuberculosis, especially when drug resistance is suspected.</p>
								
							
								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required for the test?</h2>
								<p>No, fasting is not necessary for this test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What preparation is needed for the test?</h2>
								<p>No specific preparation is needed for this test. However, you should follow your healthcare provider's instructions for proper sample collection.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should I get this test?</h2>
								<p>This test is recommended if you have been diagnosed with tuberculosis and there's a concern about drug resistance. It's particularly useful when the response to the standard treatment is unsatisfactory.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does the test measure?</h2>
								<p>The SIREP test measures the sensitivity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to the four first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs: Streptomycin, Isoniazid, Rifampicin, and Ethambutol. If the bacterium is resistant to any of these drugs, it might require a different treatment approach.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should the test be done?</h2>
								<p>The frequency of this test depends on individual health status, response to treatment, and your healthcare provider's recommendations.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are normal values for this test?</h2>
								<p>Normal values in this test indicate that the Mycobacterium tuberculosis is sensitive to the four first-line drugs tested. However, interpretation of results should always be done by a healthcare provider.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should be taken?</h2>
								<p>No special precautions are needed before this test. However, proper sample collection as per your healthcare provider's instructions is crucial to ensure accurate results.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the levels?</h2>
								<p>Factors that can affect test results include incorrect sample collection, specific strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the patient's overall health status.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult if the test result is abnormal?</h2>
								<p>If the test results are abnormal, indicating resistance to any of the first-line drugs, a consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can medications affect the test result?</h2>
								<p>Yes, the current use of anti-tuberculosis medications could potentially influence the test results. It's important to inform your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test be done on pregnant women?</h2>
								<p>Yes, this test can be performed on pregnant women suspected of having tuberculosis.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the risks associated with the test?</h2>
								<p>The risks associated with this test are minimal and are mainly related to the sample collection process. If tissue or fluid samples are required, there may be risks associated with the procedure.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How reliable is the test?</h2>
								<p>The AFB/TB - Drug Sensitivity for 1st Line 4 Drugs test is reliable for assessing the sensitivity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. However, the results should always be interpreted in the context of the patient's overall health status and other diagnostic information.</p>

						
								<p>The AFB/TB - Drug Sensitivity for 1st Line 4 Drugs test is a crucial tool in the management of tuberculosis. It can guide the formulation of an effective treatment plan, especially in cases where drug resistance is a concern. Accurate results depend on proper sample collection, so it's essential to follow your healthcare provider's instructions.</p>
