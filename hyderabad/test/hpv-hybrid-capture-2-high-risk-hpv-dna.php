<div class="post-text">
<p>The <strong>HPV Hybrid Capture 2 High Risk HPV DNA Test</strong> is a screening tool used to detect high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections that can lead to cervical cancer. The test looks for the DNA of 13 high-risk types of HPV in cervical cells </p>
<p>HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, with certain types being linked to the development of cervical cancer. The high-risk types identified by the HPV Hybrid Capture 2 test are: HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68. Types 16 and 18 are responsible for about 70% of all cases of cervical cancer </p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the HPV Hybrid Capture 2 High Risk HPV DNA Test?</h2>
<p> This is a diagnostic test that identifies high-risk HPV infections, specifically the 13 types associated with the development of cervical cancer.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is this test performed?</h2>
<p> The test is performed to screen for high-risk HPV infections, which can lead to cervical cancer. The detection of these types can guide preventive and treatment strategies.</p>

	<!--//section achieved-->
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the test conducted?</h2>
<p> The test is performed using a cervical swab sample, which is then evaluated in a laboratory.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does a positive result mean?</h2>
<p> A positive result indicates the presence of high-risk HPV DNA in the cervical cells. This doesn't necessarily mean you have or will develop cervical cancer, but it implies an increased risk, necessitating further evaluation and monitoring.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does a negative result mean?</h2>
<p> A negative result means that high-risk HPV DNA was not detected in the sample, suggesting a lower risk of developing cervical cancer.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long will it take to get the test results?</h2>
<p> Results are typically available within 1-2 weeks.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any specific instructions to follow before the test?</h2>
<p> There are no specific instructions regarding food or drink consumption before the test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I get HPV even if I'm vaccinated?</h2>
<p> Yes, the <strong>HPV</strong> vaccine does not protect against all types of HPV, so it's possible to contract the virus even after vaccination.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can the results of this test affect my treatment plan?</h2>
<p> The results can guide treatment decisions and help in determining the need for further monitoring or treatment, such as a colposcopy or biopsy.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the risks associated with the test?</h2>
<p>The test involves minimal risks associated with taking a cervical swab.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How often should I get tested?</h2>
<p>The frequency of testing depends on your age, sexual activity, HPV vaccination status, and other risk factors. Your healthcare provider can give you personalized recommendations.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can men be tested?</h2>
<p>While there is no approved HPV test for men, HPV can cause health problems in men, too.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can HPV be treated?</h2>
<p>There is no cure for the HPV virus itself, but the health problems it causes can often be treated.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can HPV be prevented?</h2>
<p>Yes, <strong>HPV</strong> can be prevented through vaccination, regular screenings, and safe sex practices.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are high-risk HPV types?</h2>
<p>High-risk HPV types are those that are more likely to cause cancer. The 13 types detected by this test are all considered high-risk.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Is this test only for women?</h2>
<p>While it is primarily used for women, men can also contract HPV. However, there is currently no approved test for HPV in men.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What happens if my test results are positive?</h2>
<p>If your test results are positive, your healthcare provider will discuss further testing or treatment options with you.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> If my test is negative, am I clear of all types of HPV?</h2>
<p>No, a negative test result means you're clear of the 13 high-risk types of HPV the test detects. Other types not detected by the test could still be present.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can I get re-infected with HPV?</h2>
<p>Yes, it's possible to get re-infected with the same or different HPV types.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> If I've had the HPV vaccine, do I still need to get tested?</h2>
<p>Yes, even if you've had the HPV vaccine, regular HPV screenings are still recommended as the vaccine doesn't protect against all types of HPV that can cause cancer.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Is the HPV Hybrid Capture 2 High Risk HPV DNA Test suitable for all ages?</h2>
<p>The test is typically recommended for women aged 30 and above, as HPV is quite common in younger women and often clears on its own without causing health problems.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Is this test useful only for detecting cervical cancer?</h2>
<p>While the primary use of this test is to detect high-risk HPV types that can lead to cervical cancer, HPV is also linked with other types of cancer such as anal, penile, and some types of oral and throat cancers.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can HPV infections be asymptomatic?</h2>
<p>Yes, many people with HPV don't develop <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms"><b style="color:#2C53A5">symptoms</b></a> or health problems. Regular screenings can help detect HPV and the health problems it can cause.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can I do the test if I am pregnant?</h2>
<p>Yes, this test can be performed during pregnancy. Having HPV doesn't typically affect pregnancy or the baby's health.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can the test detect HPV in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals?</h2>
<p>Yes, the test can detect high-risk HPV types in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. However, vaccinated individuals are less likely to be infected with the types of HPV the vaccine protects against.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Is HPV always sexually transmitted?</h2>
<p>Most <strong>HPV</strong> infections are sexually transmitted, but you can also get the virus through close skin-to-skin contact.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Does a positive test result mean I will develop cancer?</h2>
<p>No, a positive test result doesn't mean you will develop cancer. It means you have a type of HPV that's associated with a higher risk of certain cancers. Regular monitoring and follow-up tests are important.</p>
