<div class="post-text">
<p>Cytology - FNAC with Procedure refers to a diagnostic process involving the extraction and examination of cells from lumps or masses. Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) involves using a thin, hollow needle to aspirate cells. This can be performed on various body parts, such as the thyroid gland, breast, lymph nodes, or other organs and structures. Once the cells are aspirated, they are placed on slides, stained with special dyes, and examined under a microscope for abnormalities.</p>
<p>This procedure is minimally invasive and is used to evaluate lumps or masses for signs of infections, inflammations, or cancers. It’s an essential tool for early diagnosis and helps in planning appropriate treatment strategies.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the purpose of Cytology - FNAC with Procedure?</h2>
<p>Cytology - FNAC with Procedure is used to investigate and diagnose lumps or masses. It’s effective in identifying
    cancers, infections, inflammatory diseases, and other abnormalities.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the FNAC procedure performed?</h2>
<p>During FNAC, a healthcare professional inserts a thin, hollow needle into the lump or mass to extract cells. The
    cells are then placed on slides, stained, and examined under a microscope by a pathologist.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is the FNAC procedure painful?</h2>
<p>There may be some discomfort or pain during the FNAC procedure. The area is usually numbed with a local anesthetic,
    and patients might feel pressure or a pricking sensation when the needle is inserted.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What kind of conditions can be diagnosed with this procedure?</h2>
<p>FNAC can diagnose a wide range of conditions, including cancer, infections, inflammatory diseases, and benign
    growths. It’s commonly used for evaluating lumps in the breast, thyroid, or lymph nodes.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the risks associated with the FNAC procedure?</h2>
<p>The risks of FNAC are generally low but can include infection, bleeding, and bruising at the needle insertion site.
    Rarely, there may be insufficient cell material for conclusive analysis.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How should I prepare for the FNAC procedure?</h2>
<p>Generally, no specific preparation is needed. However, patients should inform the healthcare provider about any
    medications they are taking, especially blood thinners, and follow any specific instructions given.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long does the FNAC procedure take?</h2>
<p>The FNAC procedure itself is usually quick, often taking less than 30 minutes. However, the time in the clinic or
    hospital may be longer due to waiting, preparation, and post-procedure observation.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should one consider undergoing an FNAC procedure?</h2>
<p>FNAC should be considered when there’s a lump or mass that needs investigation. A healthcare provider may recommend
    FNAC based on a physical examination or imaging studies.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can FNAC be used to obtain samples from internal organs?</h2>
<p>Yes, FNAC can be used to obtain samples from deeper tissues and organs with the guidance of imaging techniques such
    as ultrasound or CT scan.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How reliable are the results of an FNAC procedure?</h2>
<p>The reliability of FNAC results depends on several factors, including the quality of the sample, the expertise of the
    healthcare professional performing the procedure, and the pathologist’s experience.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What happens if the results indicate abnormal cells?</h2>
<p>If abnormal cells are detected, further diagnostic tests or treatment may be necessary. The course of action will
    depend on the nature of the abnormal cells and the patient’s overall health.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the results of the FNAC procedure?</h2>
<p>The sample quality, stain used, and the pathologist’s experience can affect the results. Also, patient factors like
    infections or medications can sometimes affect cellular appearance.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can FNAC differentiate between benign and malignant growths?</h2>
<p>Yes, FNAC can often differentiate between benign and malignant growths based on cellular appearance and
    characteristics.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long will it take to receive the results?</h2>
<p>It usually takes between 2-5 days to receive the results, but this can vary based on the laboratory.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Which doctor should I consult in case of abnormal results?</h2>
<p>In case of abnormal results, consult the doctor who ordered the test. You may be referred to specialists such as
    surgeons, oncologists, or endocrinologists depending on the findings.</p>
 
<p>Cytology - FNAC with Procedure is a valuable diagnostic tool that allows for the timely investigation of lumps or masses. Being minimally invasive, it is often preferred for initial evaluation before more invasive procedures are considered. Understanding the process and following healthcare provider instructions can help ensure the procedure goes smoothly. If abnormal cells are detected, prompt consultation with a healthcare provider is crucial for determining the appropriate course of action.</p>
