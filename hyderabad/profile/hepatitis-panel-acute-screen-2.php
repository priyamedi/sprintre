<div class="post-text">
<p>Hepatitis, a medical condition defined by the inflammation of the liver, is typically caused by a viral infection. However, other possible causes of hepatitis include autoimmune hepatitis and hepatitis that occurs as a secondary result of medications, drugs, toxins, and alcohol. Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g., alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis.</p>
<p>Hepatitis can be temporary (acute) or long term (chronic) depending on whether it lasts for less than or more than six months. The Hepatitis Panel - Acute Screen-II is a blood test that checks for different types of hepatitis viruses, including Hepatitis A (HAV), Hepatitis B (HBV), Hepatitis C (HCV), and Hepatitis E (HEV). This panel consists of different individual tests that detect specific antibodies and antigens related to these viruses.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the importance of the Hepatitis Panel - Acute Screen-II test?</h2>
<p>This panel is critical for diagnosing and distinguishing between different types of viral hepatitis infections. Early
    detection and identification of the type of hepatitis virus causing the infection can help in starting the right
    treatment promptly and prevent complications like liver failure, cirrhosis, or liver cancer.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required for this test?</h2>
<p>No, fasting is not required for this test. You can have your regular meals before the test.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should I get this test?</h2>
<p>You should get this test if you have symptoms of hepatitis like jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), dark urine,
    extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. It is also recommended for individuals with a high risk of
    exposure to hepatitis viruses, such as healthcare workers, people with multiple sexual partners, intravenous drug
    users, and people with chronic liver disease.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does the test measure?</h2>
<p>The test measures the presence of specific antigens or antibodies in the blood produced in response to hepatitis A,
    B, C, and E viruses.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I get tested?</h2>
<p>The frequency of testing depends on your risk factors for hepatitis. If you are at a high risk, your healthcare
    provider might recommend regular testing. However, for most people, testing is only needed if symptoms occur or if
    there is a chance that you've been exposed to the hepatitis viruses.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
<p>A negative result for all components of the panel is considered normal, indicating no active or recent infection with
    these viruses. However, 'normal' should be interpreted based on individual patient history and symptoms.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should I take before the test?</h2>
<p>No special precautions are necessary before the test. However, it is always a good idea to inform your doctor of any
    medications, vitamins, or supplements you are taking.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the levels of these antibodies or antigens?</h2>
<p>Factors that can affect the levels include recent or past infection with hepatitis viruses, vaccination against
    hepatitis A or B, and the presence of immunosuppressive conditions like HIV infection, which can affect the body's
    immune response.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult if I have abnormal results?</h2>
<p>If you have abnormal results, it is recommended that you consult a hepatologist or a gastroenterologist. They can
    interpret your results, make a diagnosis, and guide you with further management.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any specific preparations for this test?</h2>
<p>No specific preparations are necessary for this test. You can continue with your normal diet and routine activities
    before the test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the test performed?</h2>
<p>The test is performed using a blood sample. A healthcare provider will draw blood from a vein, usually in your arm.
    The sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can a person be asymptomatic and still have hepatitis?</h2>
<p>Yes, it is possible. Many people with hepatitis, particularly Hepatitis B and C, do not show any symptoms until the
    disease has progressed, which underlines the importance of routine screening in high-risk individuals.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I get tested for only one type of Hepatitis virus?</h2>
<p>Yes, individual tests are available for each type of Hepatitis virus. However, the acute screen panel is useful when
    the type of infection is unknown.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What treatments are available if I test positive for any Hepatitis virus?</h2>
<p>The treatment depends on the type of hepatitis virus. Hepatitis A and E usually do not require specific treatment and
    are self-limiting. Hepatitis B and C often require antiviral medications. Your healthcare provider can guide you
    about the best treatment option based on your condition.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the test differentiate between a past infection and a current infection?</h2>
<p>Yes, the type of antibodies present can indicate a past or current infection. IgM antibodies usually indicate a
    recent or current infection, while the presence of IgG antibodies indicates past infection or immunity.</p>
<p>The Hepatitis Panel - Acute Screen-II is a comprehensive panel for diagnosing and
    differentiating between Hepatitis A, B, C, and E. It aids in early detection and management of hepatitis, helping to
    prevent severe liver diseases. Always consult your healthcare provider for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
    Regular testing and vaccination are key to preventing the spread of these diseases.</p>
