<div class="post-text">
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Weed Pollen Common Ragweed test is used to detect if an individual has an allergy to the pollen of the common ragweed, a weed found worldwide. This weed is known to trigger seasonal allergies, or hay fever, among individuals who are hypersensitive to it. </p>
<p>Allergies are an immune system's overreaction to substances that are usually harmless, such as specific types of pollen, dust mites, or certain foods. When it comes to common ragweed pollen, the immune system of an allergic person identifies it as a threat, which then triggers a response leading to symptoms like sneezing, itching, congestion, and in severe cases, respiratory distress. </p>
