<div class="post-text">
<p>Haemoglobin is a protein present in the red blood cells responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. It also helps in carrying carbon dioxide from the body's tissues back to the lungs. Typically, haemoglobin is contained within the red blood cells. However, when red blood cells are destroyed or broken down, haemoglobin can be released into the blood plasma. This condition, known as haemolysis, can be caused by numerous factors including infections, autoimmune diseases, certain medications, or inherited conditions.
 </p>
<p>A Haemoglobin-Free in Plasma test measures the level of free haemoglobin in the blood plasma. Higher than normal levels may indicate a high rate of red blood cell destruction, which could be due to various health conditions. It is also used to monitor the effectiveness of treatments for conditions that cause haemolysis.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do the results of this test mean? </h2>
<p>High levels of free haemoglobin in plasma may indicate haemolysis or the breakdown of red blood cells. It could be a sign of various health conditions, including infections, autoimmune diseases, certain medications, or inherited conditions.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is the Haemoglobin-Free in Plasma test risky?</h2>
<p>The risks associated with this test are minimal and similar to those of a regular blood draw.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can lifestyle or dietary factors affect the test results?</h2>
<p>Certain drugs and substances such as high-dose vitamin C, lead, and copper can increase the rate of red blood cell destruction and may affect the test results.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are modifiable factors affecting the results? </h2>
<p>The use of certain medications and exposure to certain substances such as lead and copper can affect the test results. These are modifiable factors as changes can be made to reduce exposure or alter medication use.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are non-modifiable factors affecting the results?</h2>
<p>Certain inherited conditions that cause an increased rate of red blood cell destruction can affect the test results. These are non-modifiable factors as they cannot be changed.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What should I do if my test results are abnormal?</h2>
<p>If your test results are abnormal, you should consult with your doctor to understand the cause and discuss potential treatments.</p>
