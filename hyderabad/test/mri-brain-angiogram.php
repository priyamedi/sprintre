							<p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Brain + Angiogram is a non-invasive diagnostic procedure
								used to examine the brain and its blood vessels. It combines the technology of an MRI,
								which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain, with
								an angiogram, which visualizes blood vessels.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Specific Instructions:</h2>

							<p>Before undergoing an MRI Brain + Angiogram, you should remove all metal objects such as
								jewelry, watches, and hairpins as these can interfere with the MRI machine's function.
								Inform your healthcare professional if you have any metallic implants, hearing aids, or
								cardiac devices. No fasting is required for this test, and you can continue taking your
								regular medications unless directed otherwise by your doctor. Let your doctor know if
								you have a history of kidney problems, as the contrast dye used in this procedure can
								cause complications.MRI Brain + Angiogram provides detailed pictures of the brain and
								the blood vessels in and around it. This helps doctors diagnose conditions such as brain
								tumors, strokes, aneurysms, or vascular malformations. It can also help detect and
								monitor diseases that affect the blood vessels like atherosclerosis.</p>



							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the process of an MRI Brain + Angiogram?</h2>
							<p>You will lie on a movable table that slides into the MRI machine. During the procedure,
								the machine will make a loud noise, which is normal. If a contrast dye is used, it will
								be injected into a vein in your arm.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is the procedure painful?</h2>
							<p>You should not feel any pain during the MRI Brain + Angiogram, though some people may
								find lying still for an extended period uncomfortable.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long does the procedure take?</h2>
							<p>The procedure typically takes between 1 to 2 hours.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the risks associated with an MRI Brain + Angiogram?</h2>
							<p>MRI is generally safe and does not use radiation. However, the contrast material used can
								cause side effects in some people, such as an allergic reaction or kidney problems.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How soon will I receive my results?</h2>
							<p>Typically, you can expect to receive your results within a few days. Your doctor will
								discuss the findings with you.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What happens if the results are abnormal?</h2>
							<p>Abnormal results could indicate a variety of conditions such as brain tumors, stroke, or
								aneurysms. Your doctor will guide you through the next steps, which could involve
								further testing or treatment.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult if my results are abnormal?</h2>
							<p>Depending on the findings, you may need to consult a neurologist, a neurosurgeon, or a
								radiologist.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there alternatives to an MRI Brain + Angiogram?</h2>
							<p>Yes, other imaging techniques such as CT scans or ultrasound may also be used to examine
								the brain and its blood vessels, but the choice of technique depends on your specific
								condition and the information your doctor needs.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is contrast material always used in an MRI Brain + Angiogram?</h2>
							<p>Contrast material is not always used, but it can help to provide clearer images of the
								brain's structures and blood vessels. Your doctor will decide if it is necessary for
								your test.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How often should I have an MRI Brain + Angiogram?</h2>
							<p>The frequency of this test depends on your individual health situation and the nature of
								the condition being monitored or diagnosed. Your doctor will advise you on how often you
								should have this test.</p>
							<p>MRI Brain + Angiogram is a highly effective diagnostic tool in detecting and monitoring
								conditions that affect the brain and its blood vessels. It's a safe and relatively quick
								procedure that provides highly detailed images. Always remember to follow the
								instructions given by your healthcare professional to ensure optimal results.</p>
