<p>Methotrexate is a medication that is often used to treat certain types of cancer and other severe health conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. A Methotrexate test is a blood test that measures the amount of methotrexate in your blood. It's crucial to monitor methotrexate levels to ensure they are within a therapeutic range, not too low to be ineffective nor too high to cause toxicity. <br><br>
Methotrexate works by interfering with the growth of certain cells in the body, particularly cells that reproduce quickly, such as cancer cells, bone marrow cells, and skin cells. By hindering the production of a particular form of folic acid, the drug impedes DNA synthesis and cell reproduction. Despite its benefits, methotrexate can lead to various side effects, some of which can be serious. That's why it's important to perform regular methotrexate tests to monitor the drug's effectiveness and prevent harmful effects. </p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">  How often should I get this test done? </h2>
	<p> The frequency of testing depends on your doctor's advice. In general, the test is done regularly when you start taking methotrexate and then at intervals to monitor your response to the drug.</p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the normal values for the Methotrexate test? </h2>
	<p>The normal values can vary based on your individual health condition and the specific laboratory procedures. Your doctor will interpret your results based on these factors. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What if my Methotrexate levels are too high? </h2>
	<p>High methotrexate levels can lead to methotrexate toxicity, which can cause serious side effects. These can include mouth sores, liver damage, lung problems, and low blood cell counts. If your levels are too high, your doctor may adjust your medication. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What factors can affect Methotrexate levels?</h2>
	<p>  Various factors can affect methotrexate levels, including kidney function, hydration status, and interactions with other medications.</p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">  Can I take methotrexate if I am pregnant? </h2>
	<p>No, methotrexate is generally avoided during pregnancy as it can cause birth defects. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">  How is the Methotrexate test done? </h2>
	<p> The Methotrexate test is done using a blood sample taken from a vein in your arm.</p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can methotrexate levels affect my other lab results?  </h2>
	<p>Yes, high levels of methotrexate can affect results of other tests, especially those related to liver function and blood cell counts. </p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the link between methotrexate and folic acid?  </h2>
	<p>Methotrexate works by inhibiting a form of folic acid, an essential vitamin for cell growth. This action slows down the growth of rapidly dividing cells. </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult if my methotrexate levels are abnormal?  </h2>
	<p> If your methotrexate levels are abnormal, you should consult the doctor who prescribed the medication. This could be an oncologist, rheumatologist, or dermatologist, depending on the condition for which you are being treated.</p>
