								<p>The Pancreatic Marker Profile is a comprehensive test that measures the levels of several markers in your blood: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9), gastrin, and insulin. These markers can provide valuable information about your pancreatic health and help diagnose conditions such as pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.</p>
								<p>Understanding your marker levels can be particularly useful if you're experiencing symptoms of a pancreatic disorder, such as abdominal pain, jaundice, weight loss, or digestive problems. It can also be helpful in monitoring the effectiveness of treatment for pancreatic conditions.</p>
