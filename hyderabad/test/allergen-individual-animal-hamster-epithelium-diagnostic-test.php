								<p>The Allergen, Individual - Animal Hamster Epithelium Diagnostic Test is a critical test to identify whether an individual has an allergic reaction to hamster epithelium. This test measures the levels of specific antibodies in the blood that are produced when the immune system responds to exposure to hamster epithelium. It is particularly useful for people who often interact with hamsters, such as pet owners, pet shop employees, or those in certain research environments.</p>
								<p>Allergies are an overreaction of the immune system to substances that are typically harmless, like hamster epithelium. When the body encounters an allergen, it reacts by producing antibodies against it. This reaction can result in symptoms that range from mild, such as itching or sneezing, to severe and potentially life-threatening.</p>
