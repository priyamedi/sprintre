							<p>Oranges are one of the most popular fruits around the world, known for their juicy

								reactions to oranges. The Allergen, Individual - Food Orange test is a blood test that
								determines if a person has an allergy to oranges. It measures the presence of specific
								Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies that are produced in response to proteins found in
								oranges. Being aware of an orange allergy is vital for dietary management and avoiding
								potential allergic reactions that could affect one's health and well-being. </p>
