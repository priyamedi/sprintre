							<p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the abdomen is an advanced diagnostic technique that
								uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of organs and structures
								in the abdomen. A Triphasic MRI is a specialized form of MRI where images are taken in
								three different phases: the arterial phase, the portal venous phase, and the delayed
								phase. This technique is particularly useful in assessing the blood supply to the liver
								and detecting liver lesions.
							</p>
							<p>
								The liver is a highly vascular organ and many of the liver diseases including tumors,
								have a characteristic blood supply pattern. A Triphasic MRI allows doctors to evaluate
								the organ in three phases of blood supply which can be crucial in diagnosing various
								liver conditions.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the arterial phase, the concentration of contrast medium is higher in the artery than
								in the vein, this phase helps in identifying lesions that are supplied by the hepatic
								artery.
							</p>
							<p>
								The portal venous phase involves capturing images when the contrast material is in the
								liver's main vein, the portal vein.
							</p>
							<p>
								The delayed phase is when the contrast material is slowly leaving the blood and entering
								the liver’s cells.
							</p>
							<p>
								The comparison between these three phases can provide invaluable information about liver
								function and the nature of liver lesions.
							</p>
							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Specific Instructions:</h2>
							<ul>

								<li>
									<p> <strong>Fasting : </strong> Typically, you may be asked to fast for 4-6 hours
										before your scan.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> <strong>Allergies : </strong> Inform your doctor if you have any known allergies,
										especially to gadolinium or other MRI contrast agents.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> <strong>Medications : </strong> Inform your doctor about any medications you are
										taking.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> <strong>Pregnancy : </strong> If you are pregnant or suspect you might be, inform
										your doctor as the safety of MRI scans during pregnancy is not fully
										established.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> <strong>Clothing : </strong> Wear comfortable and loose-fitting clothing. You may
										be asked to change into a gown.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> <strong>Metal Objects : </strong> Remove all metallic items including jewelry, as
										the MRI machine uses strong magnets.</p>
								</li>

							</ul>



							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the process of getting the test done?</h2>
							<p>When you arrive for your MRI, you might first have a short medical interview. You will
								then be asked to change into a gown and remove all metal objects. A contrast dye will be
								administered through an intravenous line. You will lie on an MRI table that will slide
								into the MRI machine. It's important to remain still during the scan. The entire process
								usually takes around 60-90 minutes.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the importance of getting this test done?</h2>
							<p>A Triphasic MRI is crucial in evaluating liver lesions and can help in the diagnosis of
								liver cancer, hemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia, and other liver diseases. It is
								also used to plan liver surgery or liver transplants.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required?</h2>
							<p>Yes, typically a 4-6 hour fast is required.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What information does it give?</h2>
							<p>Triphasic MRI gives detailed images of the liver in three different phases of blood
								supply. It can help identify the nature of liver lesions and can give information
								regarding their blood supply which can be crucial in diagnosis and treatment planning.
							</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done?</h2>
							<p>This depends on the specific medical condition. Your doctor will guide you on how often
								this test should be performed.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should be taken?</h2>
							<p>Inform your doctor of allergies, medications, and pregnancy. Remove metal objects and
								follow the fasting guidelines.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values?</h2>
							<p>Normal findings would show a liver without any lesions and normal blood flow through the
								liver.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors affect the values?</h2>
							<p>Factors that can affect the images include patient movement, the presence of metal in the
								body, and improper fasting.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should be consulted in case of abnormal findings?</h2>
							<p>In case of abnormal findings, a consultation with a gastroenterologist or a hepatologist
								is often recommended.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is the procedure painful?</h2>
							<p>No, the procedure itself is not painful, but some people might find lying still for the
								duration of the scan uncomfortable.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can claustrophobia be a problem during MRI?</h2>
							<p>Yes, as the MRI involves lying in a narrow tube, people with claustrophobia might find it
								distressing. It's important to inform your doctor if you have claustrophobia.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks involved?</h2>
							<p>MRI is a very safe procedure. However, as it involves the use of a contrast agent,
								there's a minimal risk of an allergic reaction. The strong magnetic field is generally
								not harmful but can cause problems if metal is present in the body.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I take my regular medications?</h2>
							<p>In most cases, you can continue your regular medications, but it's best to inform your
								doctor about all the medications you are taking.</p>
							<p>This MRI is an invaluable tool for evaluating various liver conditions, particularly
								liver lesions. Its ability to provide detailed images in different phases of blood
								supply to the liver makes it a superior diagnostic tool. If you are scheduled for a
								Triphasic Abdominal MRI, it's important to follow all the guidelines provided by your
								healthcare facility and not hesitate to ask questions if you have any doubts or
								concerns.</p>
