								<p>The Copper (Cu) - 24 Hours Urine Test is an important diagnostic tool that measures the amount of copper excreted in the urine over a 24-hour period. Copper is an essential trace element that plays a vital role in the health of the human body. It is involved in various physiological processes, including the production of red blood cells, maintaining nerve cells, and supporting the immune system. However, both an excess and a deficiency of copper can have detrimental effects on health. This test helps in assessing copper levels and can be useful in diagnosing and monitoring various health conditions, such as Wilson's disease and Menkes disease. <br><br>
Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder where the body retains excess copper, while Menkes disease is characterized by an inability to properly absorb copper. Both conditions can have severe consequences if not properly managed. The Copper (Cu) - 24 Hours Urine Test is essential in the diagnostic process and management of these and other related conditions.
