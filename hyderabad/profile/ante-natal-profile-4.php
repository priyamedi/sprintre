<div class="post-text">
<p> Ante Natal Profile IV is an extension of Ante Natal Profile II, with the addition of Antibody Screening and
Rh & Kell typing. It is designed to provide comprehensive information about a pregnant woman's health,
as well as the health of her unborn child. The profile combines tests such as Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)

</p>
<p>Antibody, Blood Grouping and Typing (ABO and Rh), Complete Urine Examination (CUE), Complete Blood
Count with Peripheral Smear (CBC with PS), Creatinine, Random Glucose, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen
(HBsAg), HIV 1 and 2 Antibody, Rapid Plasma Reagin/Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (RPR/VDRL),
Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Urea, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Hemoglobin Variant Analysis,
Antibody Screening, and Rh & Kell typing. </p>
<p>Antibody Screening is used to detect atypical antibodies in the blood that may affect the pregnancy. Rh
& Kell typing are important to identify blood group incompatibilities that may lead to hemolytic disease
of the newborn (HDN), a serious condition that can cause anemia and other complications in newborns.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the Ante Natal Profile IV?</h2>
	<p>
Ante Natal Profile IV is an extensive set of tests performed during pregnancy. It includes all the tests of
Ante Natal Profile II and additional tests for Antibody Screening, and Rh & Kell typing.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Why are Antibody Screening and Rh & Kell typing included in this profile?</h2>
<p>
Antibody Screening is included to detect atypical antibodies in the blood that may impact the
pregnancy. Rh & Kell typing is done to identify any blood group incompatibility between the mother and
the unborn child, which could potentially lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn, a serious condition.</p>
