<div class="post-text">
<p>Cabbage, a leafy green or purple plant, is widely consumed across the world. It is packed with nutrients, including vitamin C and vitamin K. Despite its health benefits, some people may be allergic to cabbage. These individuals' immune systems may overreact to proteins found in cabbage, triggering an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Cabbage test helps determine if an individual is allergic to cabbage. It identifies the presence of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, produced by the body's immune system in response to an allergen, specifically cabbage in this case.</p>
