<div class="post-text">
<p>The Allergy Panel - Drugs 10 Parameters test is a comprehensive evaluation designed to identify potential allergies to commonly used medications. The panel tests for allergic reactions to Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH), Penicillin V, Penicillin G, Human Insulin, Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, Paracetamol, Ciprofloxacin, Sulfa drugs, and Total Immunoglobulin E (IgE).
 </p>
<p>Allergies occur when the immune system overreacts to substances that are usually harmless, in this case, medications. The body perceives these substances as threats and produces an immune response, causing symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Identifying the specific medications that cause allergic reactions can help avoid future exposure and adverse reactions.
