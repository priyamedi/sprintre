<div class="post-text">
<p>The Citrate - 24 hrs Urine test measures the amount of citrate, a type of salt, in urine collected over a 24-hour period. Citrate naturally occurs in the body and plays key roles in energy production, bone health, and preventing kidney stones. The kidneys typically reabsorb citrate, so only a small amount should be present in the urine. Higher or lower levels of urinary citrate can be an indication of certain health conditions, such as kidney stones or metabolic disorders. </p>
