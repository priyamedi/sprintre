<p><strong>Special Stain - 2 to 5 Stains</strong> is an essential diagnostic test that utilizes different stains to analyze tissue samples microscopically. This comprehensive analysis helps in detecting and characterizing various substances in the tissues, such as carbohydrates, connective tissue fibers, and different microorganisms. It is especially useful in diagnosing various diseases, including infections, cancer, and autoimmune disorders.</p>
<p>These stains include Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS), Mucicarmine, Congo Red, Reticulin, Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB), Gomori Methenamine Silver (GMS), Prussian Blue, Masson's Trichrome, Luxol Fast Blue, Fite's stain, Elastic stain, Giemsa, and Alcian Blue. Each stain targets specific elements in the tissue. For instance, PAS stains carbohydrates, while Congo Red is used to detect amyloid proteins. The selection of stains used depends on what your doctor is looking for in the tissue sample.</p>
