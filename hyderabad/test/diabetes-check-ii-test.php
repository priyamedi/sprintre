<div class="post-text">
<p>Diabetes Check - II is a comprehensive panel of tests designed to evaluate both the blood sugar levels and the impact of diabetes on various body functions. Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels. Over time, high blood sugar can lead to various complications including heart disease, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems.</p>

<p>This panel includes a Complete Urine Examination to check for the health of the kidneys which can be affected in diabetes. It also includes blood tests: Glucose – Fasting & Postprandial to measure blood sugar levels at two different times, HbA1c to look at the long-term control of blood sugar, and Lipid Profile to evaluate the levels of different fats in the blood which is crucial in assessing heart disease risk.</p>
