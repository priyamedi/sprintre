<div class="post-text">
<p>The Tricyclic Antidepressant Screen is a blood test that checks for the presence and levels of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in the body. TCAs are a type of medication commonly used to treat mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and certain types of pain.</p>
<p>This test can be used for several reasons. It might be ordered as part of a routine monitoring when you're taking a TCA to ensure that the levels in your body are within the therapeutic range - not too high (which could cause toxicity) and not too low (which might mean the dosage is insufficient). The test might also be ordered if a TCA overdose is suspected.</p>
