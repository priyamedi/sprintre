								<p>The Vitamin B12 Binding Capacity - Unsaturated (Transcobalamin) test is used to assess the amount of Transcobalamin in your blood that is available to bind with Vitamin B12. Transcobalamin, a protein, is essential for transporting Vitamin B12 from the bloodstream to the cells within your body where it's required for DNA synthesis, red blood cell production, and maintaining a healthy nervous system.</p>
								<p>Deficiencies in Transcobalamin can lead to Vitamin B12 deficiency, as the vitamin cannot be effectively transported to the cells. This can result in symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, pale skin, and neurological problems.</p>
