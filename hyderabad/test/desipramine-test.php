<p>Desipramine is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs known as tricyclic antidepressants. It is used primarily to treat depression and is occasionally used for other conditions, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and nerve pain. Desipramine works by affecting the balance of certain natural chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain. Monitoring desipramine levels in the blood is important to ensure that the medication is at a therapeutic level, and to avoid potential side effects and toxicity.</p>
