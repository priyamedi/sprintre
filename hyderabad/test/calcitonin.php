<p>Calcitonin is a hormone produced in the C cells (or parafollicular cells) of the thyroid gland. It helps
regulate calcium levels in your body, working alongside parathyroid hormone (PTH) to maintain a
delicate balance. In certain conditions, including medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), the C cells may
produce an excessive amount of calcitonin, which can be detected by a blood test. This test is also used
to monitor treatment in people diagnosed with MTC and to identify MTC in family members who may
be at risk. </p>
