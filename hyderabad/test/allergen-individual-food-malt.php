<div class="post-text">
<p>Malt is a germinated cereal grain, usually barley, that has been dried in a process known as "malting". Malted barley is a key ingredient in beer and malted milk as well as various other foods and beverages. While malt is enjoyed by many, there are individuals who have an allergy to malt or to proteins in the grains used to make malt. The Allergen, Individual - Food Malt test is designed to determine whether an individual is allergic to malt by measuring the levels of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood that react to proteins in malt. </p>
