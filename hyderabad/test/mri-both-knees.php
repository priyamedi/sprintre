							<p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of both knees is a diagnostic procedure that employs a
								large magnet, radio waves, and a computer to generate detailed images of the structures
								within your knees. It is a non-invasive procedure used to diagnose injuries or diseases
								of the bones, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, muscles, and other structures within the
								knee joint.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Specific Instructions:</h2>
							<p>Before an MRI, you should inform your doctor about any health conditions or recent
								surgeries. Some people might not be able to have an MRI due to certain conditions like
								having an implanted medical device such as a pacemaker, certain types of vascular
								stents, certain types of brain aneurysm clips, certain types of prostheses, implants or
								metal fragments in your eyes, skin or body.You will likely need to change into a
								hospital gown and remove all metal objects including jewelry, eyeglasses, and dentures.
								Metal can interfere with the magnetic field used to produce the MRI images. If you have
								a fear of enclosed spaces or you're nervous about the test, talk to your doctor. They
								may provide a sedative to help you stay calm.</p>
							<p>Typically, no special preparation such as fasting is necessary for an MRI scan. However,
								you should avoid eating or drinking large quantities of fluids prior to your MRI to
								avoid needing to use the bathroom during the scan.The MRI Both Knees is used to
								investigate knee problems and guide the treatment process. It provides detailed images
								of the structures within the knee joint, including bones, cartilage, tendons, ligaments,
								and muscles. It can help diagnose various conditions and injuries, such as torn
								ligaments, tendon injuries, meniscus tears, osteoarthritis, bone fractures, tumors,
								infections, and more.</p>



							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What can I expect during the MRI of Both Knees procedure?</h2>
							<p>During the MRI scan, you will lie on a flat table that slides into the MRI machine. Your
								knees will be positioned in the center of the magnetic field. The procedure is painless,
								but you must remain still for the best quality images.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long does the MRI of Both Knees take?</h2>
							<p>The procedure usually lasts between 30 minutes to an hour.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Will I feel any pain during or after the MRI of Both Knees?</h2>
							<p>The MRI procedure itself is painless. However, lying still on the hard table for the
								duration of the procedure may cause some discomfort.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What should I do if I'm claustrophobic?</h2>
							<p>If you're claustrophobic, it's essential to inform your doctor prior to the scan. They
								may be able to provide a sedative to help you stay relaxed during the procedure.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How will I receive my results?</h2>
							<p>Once the MRI is complete, a radiologist will review the images and send a report to your
								doctor, who will discuss the results with you.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What happens if my MRI shows an abnormality?</h2>
							<p>If your MRI shows an abnormality, your doctor will discuss the results with you and may
								recommend further tests or treatments depending on the nature of the abnormality.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I have an MRI of Both Knees?</h2>
							<p>The frequency of the MRI depends on your specific health condition and your doctor's
								recommendations.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What kind of doctor should I consult if my MRI results are
								abnormal?</h2>
							<p>If your MRI results are abnormal, you should consult an orthopedic surgeon for further
								evaluation and treatment.</p>
							<p>MRI Both Knees is a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluating knee pain, injuries, and
								disorders. It provides detailed information about the structures within the knee joint,
								allowing for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Always follow your doctor's
								instructions before and after the procedure to ensure the best possible outcomes.</p>
