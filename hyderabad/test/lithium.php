<div class="post-text">
<p>The lithium blood test is a simple diagnostic test used to monitor the levels of lithium in your bloodstream. Lithium is a medication primarily used to treat bipolar disorder, a condition characterized by episodes of extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). It is also used in the treatment of major depressive disorder and certain types of headaches.
 </p>
<p>Lithium helps to stabilize mood and prevent the extreme highs and lows associated with bipolar disorder. It can reduce the severity and frequency of mania in bipolar disorder and also act as a preventative measure against bipolar depression. However, it's crucial to maintain lithium within a specific range in the blood for it to be effective and safe. Too much lithium can lead to toxicity, while too little may not effectively manage the symptoms. </p>
