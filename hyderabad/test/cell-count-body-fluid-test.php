<div class="post-text">
<p>The Cell Count - Body Fluid test is a diagnostic procedure used to evaluate the number and type of cells present in various body fluids. The test is performed on fluids like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural fluid (from the lungs), peritoneal fluid (from the abdominal cavity), and synovial fluid (from the joints). This test helps doctors diagnose different conditions and infections, including meningitis, arthritis, pleurisy, and peritonitis.</p>
<p>The test measures both the total cell count and differential cell count, identifying the types of cells present. This guide will answer frequently asked questions about the Cell Count - Body Fluid test.</p>
