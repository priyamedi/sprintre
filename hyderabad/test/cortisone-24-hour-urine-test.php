						<p>The Cortisone (Compound E) - 24-hour Urine Test is a diagnostic procedure used to measure the amount of cortisone in your urine over a 24-hour period. Cortisone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands, which are small glands located on top of each kidney. It plays an essential role in various body functions including metabolism, immune response, and inflammation control.</p>
						<p>Cortisone is often called a “stress hormone” as its production increases in response to stress. It is involved in the breakdown of protein and fat molecules to provide energy for the body during stressful situations. Abnormal levels of cortisone can be associated with various medical conditions including adrenal gland disorders, pituitary gland disorders, and chronic stress.</p>

    insufficiency, Cushing's syndrome, and adrenal tumors. It can also give insights into how your body is handling
    stress.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do abnormal cortisone levels indicate?</h2>
<p>Abnormally high levels of cortisone may indicate Cushing's syndrome, adrenal tumors, or chronic stress, while low
    levels may suggest adrenal insufficiency or Addison's disease.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with this test?</h2>
<p>There are no significant risks associated with this test. However, it is important to collect the urine samples
    correctly for accurate results.</p>
