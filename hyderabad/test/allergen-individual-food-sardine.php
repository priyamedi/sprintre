<div class="post-text">
<p>Sardines are small, oily fish that are packed with nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. They are often consumed for their potential health benefits. However, like other fish, sardines can cause allergic reactions in some individuals. The Allergen, Individual - Food Sardine test is designed to detect if a person has an allergy to sardines.</p>
<p>This diagnostic test measures the levels of specific antibodies in the blood that might be produced in response to proteins found in sardines. When a person is allergic to sardines, their immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in the fish as harmful, leading to the production of antibodies and causing allergic reactions.

<p>Adjusting your diet to avoid sardines and taking antihistamines as directed by a doctor are modifiable factors that
    can affect the levels of antibodies.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any non-modifiable factors affecting antibody levels?</h2>
<p>Genetic predisposition to allergies is a non-modifiable factor that can affect antibody levels.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should be consulted in case of an abnormal value?</h2>
<p>An allergist or immunologist should be consulted in case of an abnormal value indicating a sardine allergy.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any precautionary measures to prevent sardine allergy?</h2>
<p>Avoiding consumption of sardines and being vigilant about food labels and cross-contamination are crucial
