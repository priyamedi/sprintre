<h1 class="test-h1">Bismuth, 24 Hours Urine </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>Bismuth is a chemical element that has various uses, especially in medicine and cosmetics. In medicine, it’s often used in medications to treat stomach ulcers, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal issues. Bismuth compounds can also be used for their antibacterial properties. The Bismuth, 24 Hours Urine test measures the levels of bismuth in the urine collected over a 24-hour period. This test is important for monitoring exposure to bismuth and can aid in the diagnosis of bismuth toxicity. <br><br>
Bismuth is usually safe when used in small amounts, but excessive exposure or intake can be toxic. Bismuth toxicity can occur through occupational exposure, excessive use of bismuth-containing medications, or environmental exposure. The symptoms of bismuth toxicity can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and in severe cases, neurological symptoms such as tremors, ataxia, and cognitive dysfunction. </p>
