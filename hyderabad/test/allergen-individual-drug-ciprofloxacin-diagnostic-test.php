								<p>The Allergen, Individual - Drug Ciprofloxacin Diagnostic Test is a crucial test designed to ascertain if an individual has an allergic reaction to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin. The test measures the levels of specific antibodies produced by the immune system in response to exposure to ciprofloxacin. It is especially useful for individuals who have previously experienced adverse reactions when taking this antibiotic. <br><br>
Allergies happen when the immune system overreacts to a substance typically harmless, in this case, ciprofloxacin. When the body encounters such a substance or allergen, it reacts by producing antibodies against it, leading to symptoms that range from mild (like rash or itching) to severe and potentially life-threatening.
