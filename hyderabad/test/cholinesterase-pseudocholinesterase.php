<div class="post-text">
<p>Cholinesterase, also known as pseudocholinesterase, is an enzyme primarily found in the liver that helps break down certain types of drugs and poisons. The Cholinesterase / Pseudocholinesterase test measures the level of this enzyme in the blood. It can help doctors diagnose and monitor conditions that affect liver function or assess the body's response to certain drugs or poisons.
