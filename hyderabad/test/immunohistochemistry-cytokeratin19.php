<h1 class="test-h1">IHC - Cytokeratin 19 (CK19)</h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a diagnostic laboratory procedure used in the detection of different types of cancer. One such IHC test is for Cytokeratin 19 (CK19), a type of keratin, which are proteins that provide structure to epithelial cells. Cytokeratins are typically found in epithelial cells, which line the body's surfaces, both inside and out. They play an integral role in cellular functions like cell structure and movement, and the presence and pattern of cytokeratins can give valuable information about the health and type of a cell.</p>
<p>CK19, in particular, is an intermediate filament protein, a component of the cytoskeleton in epithelial cells. It's often used as a marker to detect certain types of cancer, as it's usually overexpressed in carcinoma cells. The IHC - CK19 test is typically performed on a tissue sample, which can be obtained through a biopsy or surgery, and the presence or absence of CK19 can help identify the presence and type of carcinoma.

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the IHC - CK19 test?</h2>
<p>This test uses immunohistochemistry to detect the presence or absence of Cytokeratin 19 in a tissue sample, which can
    help identify certain types of cancer.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is this test done?</h2>
<p>This test is done to identify and classify tumors, particularly carcinomas. It can help determine the origin of a
    tumor when the primary site is unknown.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What type of sample is required for this test?</h2>
<p>A tissue sample, obtained through a biopsy or surgery, is required for this test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Do I need to fast before this test?</h2>
<p>No, there's no need to fast before this test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long does it take to get results?</h2>
<p>It generally takes 1 to 3 days to get the results of this test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Does the presence of CK19 always indicate cancer?</h2>
<p>While the presence of CK19 is often associated with certain types of cancer, it doesn't always mean you have cancer.
    The results should be interpreted by your doctor in the context of your overall health and other diagnostic tests.
</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test be done at home?</h2>
<p>No, this test requires a tissue sample that must be collected by a healthcare professional and sent to a laboratory
    for analysis.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the test performed?</h2>
<p>The test involves staining the tissue sample with a dye that reacts with CK19. The stained sample is then examined
    under a microscope to look for the presence of CK19.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What other tests might be done along with this test?</h2>
<p>Other tests may be performed in conjunction with this one, depending on your symptoms, medical history, and the
    results of other diagnostic tests. This may include other IHC tests, imaging tests, or molecular tests.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with this test?</h2>
<p>The risks associated with this test are minimal and are usually related to the procedure of obtaining a tissue
    sample.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does it mean if CK19 is present?</h2>
<p>If CK19 is present, it could suggest the presence of certain types of cancer, particularly carcinomas. However, your
    doctor will interpret the results in the context of your overall health and other diagnostic tests.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does it mean if CK19 is not present?</h2>
<p>The absence of CK19 doesn't necessarily mean that you don't have cancer, as not all cancers express CK19. It may also
    indicate that the tumor is of non-epithelial origin.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How accurate is the IHC - CK19 test?</h2>
<p>The accuracy of the test depends on a number of factors, including the quality of the sample, the method of sample
    collection, and the technique used for the test. However, IHC tests, including the IHC - CK19 test, are generally
    considered highly accurate.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Who should order this test?</h2>
<p>The test should be ordered by your healthcare provider who suspects the presence of certain types of cancer or is
    trying to classify an unidentified tumor.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors could affect the levels of CK19 in my sample?</h2>
<p>Factors such as the type of tumor, its stage, and how aggressive it is can affect the levels of CK19. Certain
    non-cancerous conditions can also lead to increased CK19 levels.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What doctor should I see if my CK19 levels are abnormal?</h2>
<p>If your CK19 levels are abnormal, you should see a specialist such as an oncologist who deals with the treatment of
    cancer.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can CK19 levels change over time?</h2>
<p>Yes, CK19 levels can change over time, especially with treatment for the cancer. Monitoring CK19 levels can sometimes
    be used to assess the effectiveness of treatment.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any precautions I need to take before undergoing an IHC - CK19 test?</h2>
<p>There are no specific precautions you need to take before an IHC - CK19 test. However, you should inform your doctor
    of any medications you're taking as some might interfere with the test results.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test detect cancer recurrence?</h2>
<p>While the IHC - CK19 test can be useful in identifying certain types of cancer, it isn't typically used alone to
    monitor for cancer recurrence. Your doctor will use a combination of tests and assessments to monitor your
    condition.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the IHC - CK19 test is a valuable diagnostic tool in the field of oncology,
    aiding in the detection and classification of certain types of tumors. While it provides important information, the
    results should always be interpreted in the context of your overall health and other diagnostic tests. Understanding
    the purpose and implications of this test can help you make informed decisions about your health care. Always
    consult with your healthcare provider for any concerns or questions about this test.</p>
