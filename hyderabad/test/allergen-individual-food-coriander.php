<div class="post-text">
<p>Coriander, also known as cilantro, is a popular herb used in numerous dishes around the world. Despite its widespread use and various health benefits, some individuals can have an allergic reaction to coriander. To identify these individuals, the Allergen, Individual - Food Coriander test is performed. It measures the presence of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood that react to proteins in coriander.</p>

<p>An allergic reaction to coriander can occur when the immune system overreacts to proteins in the herb, leading to an allergy. This is triggered when the immune system identifies coriander proteins as harmful, even though they aren't, leading to the production of IgE antibodies. When an individual with a coriander allergy consumes the herb, these IgE antibodies cause an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Coriander test plays a crucial role in identifying a coriander allergy and helps in the management of symptoms.</p>
