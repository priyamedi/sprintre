<div class="post-text">
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Weed Pollen Rape Pollen test is a diagnostic tool that helps determine if a person has an allergy to the pollen of the Rape plant. Rape plants, also known as Brassica napus, belong to the mustard family and are commonly grown for their oil-rich seeds. The pollen produced by these plants can cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. </p>
<p>Allergic reactions occur when the immune system overreacts to harmless substances, like rape pollen. This overreaction can lead to symptoms ranging from mild, such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes, to severe, such as difficulty breathing or anaphylaxis. This test is essential in diagnosing such allergies and forming an effective treatment plan. </p>
