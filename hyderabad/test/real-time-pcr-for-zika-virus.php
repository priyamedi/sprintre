<h1 class="test-h1">Real Time PCR for Zika Virus</h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>The Real Time PCR for Zika Virus is a test used to detect the Zika virus in a person's blood. This diagnostic tool uses the method of Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) that amplifies the genetic material of the virus making it detectable.</p>
<p>Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. It was first identified in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. Its mild symptoms and limited geographical spread kept it from being recognized as a significant health threat until the major outbreak in Brazil in 2015 that linked the virus to a spike in birth defects.</p>
<p>Though the majority of individuals infected with the Zika virus do not experience symptoms, those that do often report fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. More severe complications can include Guillain-Barre syndrome and congenital abnormalities in infants born to infected mothers.</p>
<p>Now, let's delve into the Frequently Asked Questions related to this test.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the Real Time PCR for Zika Virus test ordered?</h2>
<p>The test may be ordered if you have symptoms of Zika virus infection and you live in or have recently traveled to an
    area where Zika is known to be present.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the sample collected for the test?</h2>
<p>The test requires a blood sample, which is drawn from a vein in your arm.</p>

<!--//section achieved-->

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with this test?</h2>
<p>The test is considered quite safe, with minimal risks that might be associated with blood collection, such as
    light-headedness or infection at the site of the needle prick.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How should I prepare for the test?</h2>
<p>There are no special preparations needed for the test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the Zika virus transmitted?</h2>
<p>The Zika virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. It can also be
    transmitted through sexual contact, from mother to fetus, and potentially through blood transfusion.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does a positive result mean?</h2>
<p>A positive result indicates that the Zika virus RNA is present in the blood sample and the person is likely infected
    with the virus.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can Zika virus cause complications during pregnancy?</h2>
<p>Yes, infection with Zika virus during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly and other severe
    fetal brain defects.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can Zika virus infection be prevented?</h2>
<p>The best way to prevent Zika is to avoid mosquito bites in areas where the virus is present. This can be done by
    wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, staying in places with air conditioning and window and door screens, and
    using insect repellents.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there treatments available for Zika virus infection?</h2>
<p>There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatments for Zika virus. Care is based on symptoms and includes
    rest, fluids, and use of common over-the-counter medications for fever and pain.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What should I do if I test positive for Zika virus?</h2>
<p>If you test positive for Zika virus, follow the advice of your healthcare provider. Rest, stay well-hydrated, and
    avoid mosquito bites for the first week of your illness to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the test detect Zika virus in asymptomatic individuals?</h2>
<p>Yes, the Real Time PCR for Zika virus can detect the virus in individuals who do not show any symptoms but are
    infected.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test differentiate between Zika virus and other similar viruses like dengue or
    chikungunya?</h2>
<p>Yes, the test is designed to specifically identify the Zika virus and should not cross-react with other flaviviruses
    like dengue or chikungunya.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How accurate is the Real Time PCR for Zika Virus test?</h2>
<p>The test is highly accurate but a negative result does not completely rule out the possibility of an infection. It
    may be necessary to perform additional tests.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any factors that can affect the test results?</h2>
<p>The test's accuracy can be affected by the timing of the test. The virus is usually detectable in the blood within
    the first week after symptom onset.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the next step if the test result is negative, but symptoms persist?</h2>
<p>If symptoms persist despite a negative test result, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider. Further
    diagnostic testing may be required.</p>
<p>The Real Time PCR for Zika Virus is an effective diagnostic tool that aids in the
    identification and management of Zika virus infection. By understanding the nature of the test and its implications,
    individuals can make informed healthcare decisions.</p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I get tested for Zika virus?</h2>
<p>If you're living in or traveling to an area where Zika virus is prevalent, or if you've been exposed to the virus
    (like through sexual intercourse with a partner who has been in such areas), you should consider getting tested.
    However, the frequency of testing should be discussed with your healthcare provider as it depends on your personal
    risk factors.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can a person get infected with Zika virus more than once?</h2>
<p>Current scientific understanding suggests that once a person has been infected with Zika virus, they are likely to be
    protected from future infections. However, research is ongoing and it's always best to take preventative measures.
</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the Real Time PCR for Zika Virus test detect a past infection?</h2>
<p>No, the Real Time PCR for Zika Virus test is not designed to detect past infections. It only detects current, active
    infections. If you need to determine past exposure to Zika virus, other types of tests that measure the body's
    immune response to the virus can be considered.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can Zika virus be transmitted through breastfeeding?</h2>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, there have been no reports of infants getting Zika virus through
    breastfeeding. Mothers in areas affected by the Zika virus epidemic should continue to breastfeed their infants as
    per the standard recommendations.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Who should I consult if my test results are abnormal?</h2>
<p>If your test results are abnormal, you should consult an Infectious Disease Specialist or a General Practitioner who
    can guide you on the next steps based on your symptoms and medical history.</p>
