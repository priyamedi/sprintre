								<p>The <strong>Adrenaline (Epinephrine) - Plasma test</strong> measures the level of adrenaline, a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands, in your blood. Adrenaline plays a key role in the body's 'fight or flight' response to stress, affecting heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolism. Evaluating the level of adrenaline in your blood can help your healthcare provider diagnose conditions such as adrenal tumors and adrenal insufficiency, manage treatment strategies, and monitor your health over time.</p>
