<h1 class="test-h1">Testosterone - Total </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>Testosterone, a hormone primarily produced in the testicles for men and the ovaries and adrenal glands for women, has a significant influence on the body. In men, it is mainly responsible for the development of male physical traits like body hair and muscle mass. In women, testosterone plays a lesser role, but is still necessary for overall health. It is instrumental in maintaining healthy sexual behavior, stabilizing mood, and enhancing overall well-being. Total testosterone test measures both the free and protein-bound testosterone in the body. </p>
<p>A testosterone total test is an important tool in the diagnostic landscape, providing a comprehensive overview of the testosterone levels in the body. Doctors often recommend this test if an individual is showing signs of having either too much or too little testosterone. For men, this could include symptoms such as erectile dysfunction, low libido, fatigue, depression, and difficulty concentrating. In women, high levels of testosterone can result in irregular menstrual cycles, increased body and facial hair, and acne. </p>

	Testosterone levels tend to peak in the morning and slowly decline throughout the day.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Does alcohol consumption affect Total Testosterone levels?</h2>

	testosterone production.</p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can diet influence Total Testosterone levels?</h2>
	<p>Yes, a diet that is high in unhealthy fats and sugars and low in protein can negatively affect your testosterone levels. It is recommended to maintain a balanced diet for optimal hormone health.</p>

	healthier testosterone levels.</p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What kind of doctor should I consult if my Total Testosterone level is abnormal?</h2>
	<p>If your Total Testosterone level is abnormal, you should consult a doctor who specializes in hormonal issues, such as an endocrinologist. If the abnormality is due to a symptom of a different condition, you may need to see a different specialist.</p>
