<div class="post-text">
<p>Watermelon is a hydrating and refreshing fruit that is widely consumed, especially during the summer months. It’s packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. While most people can enjoy watermelon without any adverse effects, there are some individuals who may have an allergy to watermelon. Allergen, Individual - Food Watermelon test is a diagnostic assessment that detects the presence of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood, indicative of an allergy to watermelon.
 </p>
<p>Watermelon allergy is an adverse reaction by the body's immune system to proteins found in watermelon. The immune system erroneously identifies certain proteins in watermelon as harmful and releases chemicals to counter them, leading to allergic symptoms. Identifying and managing a watermelon allergy is essential to prevent discomfort and potentially severe allergic reactions.
