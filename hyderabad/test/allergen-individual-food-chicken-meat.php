<div class="post-text">
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Chicken Meat test is a critical tool in diagnosing chicken meat allergies. This diagnostic test measures the amount of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies produced in response to chicken meat proteins in the blood. When the body mistakenly identifies chicken meat proteins as harmful substances, the immune system responds by producing these IgE antibodies, leading to an allergic reaction. </p>
<p>Although chicken meat allergy is less common than other food allergies, it can cause a range of symptoms from mild to severe. These symptoms may include skin reactions, respiratory difficulties, gastrointestinal disturbances, and in severe cases, anaphylaxis. The test is important to confirm or rule out a suspected allergy to chicken meat and to guide subsequent dietary and therapeutic decisions.
