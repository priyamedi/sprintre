<div class="post-text">
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Bakers Yeast test measures the concentration of specific antibodies, known as Immunoglobulin E (IgE), in the blood in response to Bakers Yeast. If you're experiencing symptoms such as itchy or watery eyes, runny nose, coughing, difficulty breathing, skin rash, or digestive problems after consuming yeast, your doctor may suggest this test to determine if you have a yeast allergy.</p>

<p>Bakers yeast is commonly used in bread baking and beer brewing. An allergic reaction to Bakers Yeast occurs when your immune system mistakenly identifies the yeast as a threat and releases antibodies to combat it. These antibodies then trigger an allergic response whenever you ingest yeast.</p>
