<div class="post-text">
<p>Doxepin is a medication used to treat depression and anxiety. It can also be used in lower doses to help alleviate chronic pain and to treat insomnia. It belongs to a class of medications called tricyclic antidepressants. The Doxepin test measures both the levels of doxepin and its active metabolite, nordoxepin, in the blood. This test is important to ensure that doxepin levels are within the therapeutic range - high enough to be effective, but not so high as to be toxic.</p>
<p>Having the correct levels of doxepin is crucial because inappropriate levels can either lead to ineffective treatment or cause side effects and toxicity. The monitoring of blood levels is especially important when doxepin is prescribed in conjunction with other medications, as interactions can occur.</p>
