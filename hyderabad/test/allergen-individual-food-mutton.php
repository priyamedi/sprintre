						<div class="post-text">
							<p>Mutton, which refers to the meat of an adult sheep, is a food source consumed by many
								people around the world. However, some individuals may have an adverse reaction to
								consuming mutton due to a food allergy. The Allergen, Individual - Food Mutton test is a
								blood test that identifies whether an individual has an allergy to mutton. It does this
								by detecting specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies that are present in response to
								proteins found in mutton.
