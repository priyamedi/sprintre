<div class="post-text">
<p>Calcium is a crucial mineral for various biological functions including nerve transmission, muscle
contraction, and maintaining bone and teeth strength. In addition to its presence in blood and bones,
calcium is also found in various body fluids. The Calcium-Body Fluid test measures the amount of
calcium in a specific body fluid, such as cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, or synovial fluid. </p>
<p>The measurement of calcium in body fluids can provide valuable information about certain conditions.
For example, high levels of calcium in cerebrospinal fluid might indicate bleeding in the brain or spinal
cord, while high levels in pleural fluid (the fluid around the lungs) could point towards conditions like
tuberculosis or lung cancer. Normal levels of calcium in body fluids vary depending on the type of fluid
being tested. </p>
