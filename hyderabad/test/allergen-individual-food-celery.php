<div class="post-text">
<p><strong>Allergen, Individual - Food Celery</strong> test is an examination used to ascertain if an individual has an allergy to celery. The test examines the presence of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which respond specifically to celery. The body's immune system produces these antibodies as a reaction to substances it perceives as harmful, such as certain foods, pollen, dust mites, etc. For some individuals, celery may trigger an excessive immune response leading to an allergic reaction.
 </p>
<p>This test is crucial for confirming a suspected <strong>celery allergy</strong> by measuring the amount of specific IgE antibodies in your blood reacting to celery's proteins. A doctor or healthcare professional would typically recommend this test if a patient reports allergy symptoms, such as hives, <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms/dry-or-itchy-skin"><b style="color:#2C53A5">itchy skin</b></a>, or gastrointestinal issues after consuming celery.
