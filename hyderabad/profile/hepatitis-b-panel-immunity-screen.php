						<div class="post-text">
							<p>Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can range from
								a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong condition affecting the liver.
								The Hepatitis B Panel - Immunity Screen is an important diagnostic tool in determining
								an individual's immunity status to Hepatitis B. This test checks for different proteins
								in the blood that are produced in response to the hepatitis B virus. The test can help
								determine whether you have a current or past infection or if you are immune to Hepatitis
								B because of vaccination or recovery from past infection.
							</p>
							<p>
								HBcAb (Hepatitis B core antibody) is an antibody produced in response to a protein in
								the core of the hepatitis B virus. It can indicate either a current or past infection.
								Anti HBs (Hepatitis B surface antibody) is an antibody that provides immunity against
								the hepatitis B virus. It appears in the blood following a successful vaccination or
								recovery from infection. HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) is a protein found on the
								surface of the virus and is the earliest indicator of an acute infection.

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does a positive HBcAb mean?</h2>
								<p>A positive HBcAb result means that you have been infected with Hepatitis B at some
									point. It does not distinguish between a current or past infection.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does a positive Anti-HBs mean?</h2>
								<p>A positive Anti-HBs result indicates that you are immune to Hepatitis B, either
									because of vaccination or because you have recovered from an infection.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does a positive HBsAg mean?</h2>
								<p>A positive HBsAg result indicates that you are currently infected with Hepatitis B.
								</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should I get this test done?</h2>
								<p>You should get this test done if you are at risk for Hepatitis B infection, if you
									are healthcare personnel or working in a healthcare facility, if you are about to
									receive the Hepatitis B vaccine, or if your doctor recommends it based on your
									health history.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What information does this test give?</h2>
								<p>This test provides information on whether you are currently infected with Hepatitis
									B, have been infected in the past, or are immune to the infection.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I be tested?</h2>
								<p>The frequency of testing depends on your risk factors and health status. Your doctor
									will provide guidance on how often you should be tested.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
								<p>A negative HBsAg result, positive Anti-HBs, and negative HBcAb would indicate
									immunity due to vaccination. A negative HBsAg, positive Anti-HBs, and positive HBcAb
									indicate immunity due to past infection. A positive HBsAg indicates a current
									infection.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should be taken if I am not immune?</h2>
								<p>If you are not immune to Hepatitis B, it is advisable to get vaccinated. Also,
									practice safe sex, avoid sharing needles, and exercise caution if you are in a
									high-risk environment for Hepatitis B exposure.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors affect the levels of these markers?</h2>
								<p>Factors that can affect the levels of these markers include the stage of infection,
									vaccination status, immune system health, and exposure to the virus.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should be consulted in case of abnormal value?
								</h2>
								<p>If the test results are abnormal, indicating a current infection or lack of immunity,
									consulting a doctor specializing in liver diseases or an infectious disease
									specialist is advisable.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is this test conclusive for Hepatitis B immunity or infection
									status?</h2>
								<p>The test is highly indicative of your immunity or infection status but additional
									tests may be needed to understand the complete picture, especially in cases of
									recent exposure or chronic infection.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I get vaccinated if I lack immunity?</h2>
								<p>Yes, if the test indicates that you lack immunity to Hepatitis B, it is highly
									recommended to get vaccinated to protect yourself against the virus.</p>
								<p>Understanding your immunity status to Hepatitis B is crucial, especially if you are
									at risk of exposure. The Hepatitis B Panel - Immunity Screen helps to identify
									whether you are immune to the virus, have had a past infection, or are currently
									infected. This information is vital in ensuring timely interventions and taking
									steps to protect your health. If you are not immune, getting vaccinated is an
									effective way to reduce the risk of infection. Regular screening and consultation
									with a doctor are essential for monitoring and managing your Hepatitis B status.</p>
