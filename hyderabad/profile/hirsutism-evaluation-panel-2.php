<div class="post-text">
<p>Hirsutism is a condition in women that results in excessive hair growth in a pattern similar to men. This is often a sign of hormonal imbalance. The Hirsutism Evaluation Panel II includes several tests to measure levels of different hormones in the body including DHEA-S, Testosterone-Total, Testosterone-Free, Luteinizing hormone (LH), Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and 17 Hydroxyprogesterone. These tests can help healthcare providers determine the cause of the excessive hair growth, which can be an important step in finding the right treatment.</p>
<p>The hormones tested in the Hirsutism Evaluation Panel II play a key role in the regulation of hair growth and the reproductive system in women. DHEA-S and testosterone are androgens, or male hormones, which are present in small amounts in women. If these hormones are overproduced, it can lead to symptoms such as hirsutism. LH and FSH control the menstrual cycle and the production of the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone. 17 Hydroxyprogesterone is a steroid hormone related to progesterone and is involved in the production of cortisol and other steroid hormones.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the Hirsutism Evaluation Panel II performed?</h2>
<p>The Hirsutism Evaluation Panel II is used to identify the potential causes of excessive hair growth in women. The
    test may be recommended if you are experiencing symptoms of hirsutism such as thick, dark, and coarse hair growth on
    areas of the body where men typically grow hair but women do not, including the face, chest, and back.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the Hirsutism Evaluation Panel II test performed?</h2>
<p>The test requires a blood sample which is drawn from a vein in your arm. This is typically a quick and easy procedure
    with minimal discomfort.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required for the Hirsutism Evaluation Panel II test?</h2>
<p>No, fasting is not required for the Hirsutism Evaluation Panel II test. You can eat and drink normally before the
    test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I get this test done?</h2>
<p>The frequency of this test depends on your symptoms and your healthcare provider's recommendations. If you're
    undergoing treatment for hirsutism, your doctor may request periodic testing to monitor your hormone levels and the
    effectiveness of the treatment.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do the test results mean?</h2>
<p>High levels of DHEA-S, testosterone, or 17 Hydroxyprogesterone can indicate an overproduction of androgens, which
    could be a potential cause of hirsutism. Increased levels of LH and decreased levels of FSH may suggest Polycystic
    Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), another common cause of hirsutism.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the levels of the hormones tested?</h2>
<p>Several factors can affect your hormone levels including age, menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause, certain
    medications, and underlying medical conditions such as adrenal or ovarian disorders.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">If my test results are abnormal, which doctor should I consult?</h2>
<p>If your test results are abnormal, you should consult a doctor who specializes in endocrinology or gynecology. They
    can interpret your results in the context of your overall health and symptoms, and suggest appropriate treatment
    options.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What treatments are available for hirsutism?</h2>
<p>Treatment for hirsutism often involves managing the underlying hormonal imbalance. This may involve medication to
    lower androgen levels, lifestyle changes, or cosmetic procedures to remove unwanted hair.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can hirsutism be prevented?</h2>
<p>In many cases, hirsutism cannot be prevented as it's often caused by underlying medical conditions or hormonal
    imbalances. However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and managing any underlying conditions can help manage the
    symptoms of hirsutism.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with the Hirsutism Evaluation Panel II test?</h2>
<p>The risks associated with this test are minimal and are similar to those for any routine blood draw. These may
    include minor pain or bruising at the site of the needle insertion.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any modifiable factors affecting hormone levels?</h2>
<p>Yes, lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, stress, and alcohol consumption can affect hormone levels. Regular
    exercise, a balanced diet, moderate alcohol intake, and stress management can help maintain normal hormone levels.
</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can men undergo the Hirsutism Evaluation Panel II test?</h2>
<p>While men also have these hormones in their bodies, this panel is specifically designed for evaluating excessive hair
    growth in women, which is often related to an overproduction of androgens.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can hirsutism lead to other health problems?</h2>
<p>While hirsutism itself isn't usually harmful, it can be a sign of an underlying condition that needs treatment, such
    as PCOS or adrenal gland disorders.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is there a cure for hirsutism?</h2>
<p>While there's no cure for hirsutism, treatments can effectively manage symptoms and address the underlying cause of
    the condition.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is the Hirsutism Evaluation Panel II test covered by insurance?</h2>
<p>Coverage for this test depends on your insurance provider and plan. Please contact your insurance company for
    information about your specific coverage.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can stress cause hirsutism?</h2>
<p>While stress itself isn't a direct cause of hirsutism, it can influence the balance of your hormones. Chronic stress
    can disrupt your hormonal balance, potentially leading to symptoms like excessive hair growth.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the role of DHEA-S in hirsutism?</h2>
<p>DHEA-S is a type of androgen, or male hormone. While all women produce small amounts of androgens, higher levels of
    DHEA-S can lead to male-pattern hair growth, contributing to hirsutism.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is hirsutism related to menopause?</h2>
<p>Yes, it can be. As women approach menopause, their estrogen levels decline, while their androgen levels remain
    consistent. This shift in hormone balance can cause an increase in body hair, including hirsutism.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the consequences of untreated hirsutism?</h2>
<p>Untreated hirsutism can lead to distress and psychological issues like low self-esteem and depression due to the
    physical appearance. Moreover, untreated hirsutism might indicate unmanaged underlying conditions, such as PCOS,
    which can have long-term health consequences if left untreated.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can diet influence hormone levels and hirsutism?</h2>
<p>Yes, diet can influence hormone levels. For instance, a diet high in refined carbohydrates and sugar can lead to
    insulin resistance, which can increase the body's production of androgens, thereby contributing to hirsutism.</p>
