<div class="post-text">
<p>Mango, often referred to as the “king of fruits”, is a tropical fruit loved by many for its sweet and tangy flavor. However, some individuals might have an allergy to mango. This allergy is caused by the body's immune system reacting to proteins found in mangoes. The Allergen, Individual - Food Mango test is conducted to determine if an individual has a mango allergy by detecting the presence of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood that react to proteins in mangoes. </p>
