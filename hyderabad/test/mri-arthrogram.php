								The MRI Arthrogram is a diagnostic procedure used to examine the internal structure of
								joints and to detect abnormalities such as injuries and diseases. The term "arthrogram"
								denotes the use of imaging to visualize a joint, and "MRI" stands for Magnetic Resonance
								Imaging, a technique that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed
								images of the body's organs and tissues.
							</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Specific Instructions:</h2>
							<p>For most MRI arthrograms, there are no strict dietary restrictions. However, it is
								advisable to avoid excessive intake of fluids to minimize the need for bathroom breaks
								during the procedure. Before the test, you will be asked to remove all metal objects
								from your body including jewelry, hearing aids, and eyeglasses as they can interfere
								with the magnetic field. Certain medical devices like pacemakers, cochlear implants,
								certain clips used for brain aneurysms, certain types of vascular stents, or metal
								fragments in your eyes can pose risks during MRI. Make sure to inform your doctor about
								any such devices or metallic fragments in your body.</p>
							<p>People with claustrophobia may need to discuss their concerns with their doctor before
								the procedure, as the MRI machine involves lying within a narrow, tube-like structure.
								In some cases, mild sedation might be offered. If you have allergies, particularly to
								iodine or certain drugs, inform your doctor, as a contrast material is often used in
								this procedure. Pregnant women should also notify their doctor before undergoing an
								MRI.An MRI arthrogram is a non-invasive procedure that gives doctors a detailed look at
								your joints. The MRI can capture images in multiple planes, allowing doctors to examine
								the joint from various angles. This test is particularly useful in diagnosing conditions
								such as rotator cuff tears, ligament tears, cartilage damage, and unexplained joint
								pain.</p>




							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does the MRI Arthrogram procedure involve?</h2>
							<p>The procedure begins with the injection of a contrast dye into the joint, followed by
								several X-ray images to confirm the successful spread of the dye. You will then undergo
								an MRI scan, which involves lying down on a table that slides into the MRI machine. The
								procedure usually lasts between 30 minutes to an hour.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does the MRI Arthrogram measure or show?</h2>
							<p>An MRI arthrogram provides detailed images of the soft tissues around your joints like
								ligaments, tendons, and cartilage. This can help diagnose conditions like tears in
								ligaments and tendons, degenerative joint disorders, unexplained joint pain, or
								abnormalities in the joint structure.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Do I need to prepare before undergoing an MRI Arthrogram?</h2>
							<p>There is usually no special preparation needed before an MRI arthrogram. However, it's
								important to inform your doctor about any medical devices in your body, allergies, or if
								you are pregnant.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks or side effects associated with an MRI
								Arthrogram?</h2>
							<p>The MRI Arthrogram is a safe procedure with minimal risks. However, as with any medical
								procedure, there are potential side effects and risks including allergic reaction to the
								contrast material, infection, and bleeding at the injection site. There may also be
								discomfort or pain during the injection.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How soon will I get the results of my MRI Arthrogram?</h2>
							<p>Typically, results are available within a few days. Your doctor will discuss the findings
								with you.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What happens if abnormalities are detected on my MRI Arthrogram?
							</h2>
							<p>If abnormalities are detected, your doctor will discuss these with you and propose a
								suitable treatment plan, which may include further tests, medication, or surgery.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I get this test done?</h2>
							<p>The frequency of this test entirely depends on your individual health condition. Your
								doctor will guide you about when this test is required.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Who should I consult if my test results are abnormal?</h2>
							<p>If your results are abnormal, you should consult an orthopedic surgeon or a
								rheumatologist, depending on the nature of your joint condition.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the MRI Arthrogram be used to examine all joints?</h2>
							<p>Yes, MRI arthrograms can be used to examine any joint, but they are most commonly used
								for the shoulder, knee, hip, elbow, and wrist.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can I move during the MRI scan?</h2>
							<p>No, it's important to remain as still as possible during the scan to ensure clear images.
							</p>
							<p>The MRI arthrogram is an invaluable tool in diagnosing joint conditions and planning
								their treatment. Understanding the process can help alleviate any anxiety about the test
								and ensure you are well-prepared for the procedure. As with all medical tests, it is
								crucial to discuss any concerns or questions you may have with your doctor.</p>
