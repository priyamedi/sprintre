							<p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a critical laboratory method employed to visualize specific
								proteins, known as antigens, within cells of a tissue section. The CD68 test is a type
								of IHC test that detects the CD68 antigen, which is a protein commonly found on the
								surface of macrophages, a type of white blood cell involved in inflammation and immune
								responses.
							</p>
							<p>
								By identifying and quantifying CD68 in tissue samples, researchers and clinicians can
								gain valuable insights into the role of macrophages in various conditions, including
								inflammatory diseases, <a   href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms/frequent-infections"><b style="color:#2C53A5">infections</b></a>, and certain types of cancers.

									<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the IHC - CD68 test used for?</h2>
								<p> The <strong>IHC - CD68</strong> test is used mainly for research purposes or to assist in the
									diagnosis of certain health conditions. This can include inflammatory diseases or
									certain types of cancer where cells may express CD68.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required before this test? </h2>
								<p>No, there is no need to fast before the IHC - CD68 test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What type of sample is needed for this test?</h2>
								<p> This test requires a tissue sample. The method of obtaining this sample can vary
									depending on your specific situation.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the test performed? </h2>
								<p>In the <strong>IHC - CD68</strong> test, a tissue sample is fixed, sectioned, and incubated with an
									antibody that binds to the CD68 antigen. The bound antibody is then visualized under
									a microscope.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Will the test cause any pain or discomfort? </h2>
								<p>Any discomfort associated with the <strong>IHC - CD68</strong> test typically stems from the procedure
									used to collect the tissue sample. Depending on the specific situation, this could
									involve a surgical procedure or a less invasive method, with the level of discomfort
									varying accordingly.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why might my doctor order this test?</h2>
								<p> Your doctor may order an <strong>IHC - CD68</strong> test if they suspect a condition that may
									involve macrophages or to gain more information about a certain type of cancer.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do abnormal results mean? </h2>
								<p>Abnormal results may indicate that a higher or lower than expected number of cells in
									your tissue sample are expressing CD68. This could suggest a potential health
									condition that requires further investigation.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What preparation is needed before the test?</h2>
								<p> No specific preparation is required before the IHC - CD68 test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with this test?</h2>
								<p> The primary risks associated with the <strong>IHC - CD68</strong> test are those related to the
									procedure used to collect the tissue sample. These can include potential
									complications such as <a   href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms/frequent-infections"><b style="color:#2C53A5">infection </b></a>, bleeding, or pain at the site of the procedure.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How will I receive the results? </h2>
								<p>Your healthcare provider will receive the results from the lab and discuss them with
									you.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What other tests might be conducted with the IHC - CD68 test?
								</h2>
								<p>The <strong>IHC - CD68</strong> test may be conducted alongside other diagnostic tests, including
									additional IHC tests, blood tests, or imaging studies, to provide a more
									comprehensive understanding of your health.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can this test be used to diagnose cancer? </h2>
								<p>While the IHC - CD68 test can provide valuable information about certain types of
									cancer, it should be used as part of a larger diagnostic process and not as a
									standalone test for cancer.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Does a high or low level of CD68 confirm a specific disease?
								</h2>
								<p>A high or low level of CD68 does not confirm a specific disease but can suggest a
									potential health condition that needs further investigation.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What factors can affect the results of the test? </h2>
								<p>Several factors can affect the results of the test, including the quality of the
									tissue sample, the staining process, and individual variations in protein
									expression.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Which doctor should I consult if my test result is abnormal?
								</h2>
								<p>If your test result is abnormal, you may need to consult with a hematologist, an
									oncologist, or another specialist, depending on the nature of your results and your
									overall health.</p>
								<p>Gaining a deeper understanding of the cellular components of a tissue sample is a key
									aspect of diagnosing and monitoring various health conditions. The <strong>IHC - CD68</strong> test
									offers vital insights into the presence and number of cells expressing CD68,
									providing a useful tool in the medical toolkit. As with any test, the results should
									be interpreted in the context of your overall health and other test results.</p>
