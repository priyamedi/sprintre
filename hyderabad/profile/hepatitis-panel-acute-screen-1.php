<div class="post-text">
<p>The Hepatitis Panel - Acute Screen-I is a series of blood tests used to detect current or past infections with viral hepatitis types A and B. The panel includes Hepatitis A Virus IgM Antibody (HAV-IgM), Anti-Hepatitis B Core Antibody IgM (Anti-HBc IgM), and Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg). Each of these tests provides important information to help your doctor understand your hepatitis status and guide treatment, if necessary.</p>
<p>Hepatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the liver, often caused by a viral infection. Different viruses are responsible for different types of hepatitis, each with its unique transmission mode and clinical implications. Hepatitis A and B are two common types that can cause both acute and chronic disease, with varying severity levels. This panel is particularly helpful in the acute phase, where it can aid in the diagnosis and help rule out other types.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does the Hepatitis Panel - Acute Screen-I test measure?</h2>
<p>The panel measures the presence of specific antibodies and antigens related to Hepatitis A and B viruses. Antibodies
    are proteins your immune system produces in response to harmful substances. Antigens are substances that trigger an
    immune response. In this case, the test detects the HAV-IgM, Anti-HBc IgM, and HBsAg, indicative of current or past
    infections.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the Hepatitis Panel - Acute Screen-I test important?</h2>
<p>This test is crucial for diagnosing acute infections with Hepatitis A and B. Early diagnosis can help start
    appropriate treatment, prevent complications, and avoid transmission to others.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required for this test?</h2>
<p>No, fasting is not required for the Hepatitis Panel - Acute Screen-I test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should one get this test?</h2>
<p>If you have symptoms of hepatitis such as fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, jaundice, or if you've been exposed to
    someone with Hepatitis A or B, you should consider this test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should one be tested?</h2>
<p>The frequency of testing depends on your risk factors for Hepatitis A and B, such as travel to areas with high rates
    of these diseases, certain work environments, or certain behaviors. Your doctor will recommend the best testing
    schedule for you.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values?</h2>
<p>In a healthy individual, the presence of these antigens or antibodies should be negative.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should one take?</h2>
<p>There are no specific precautions for the test itself. However, preventing hepatitis infection involves vaccination,
    safe practices like hand hygiene, safe sex, and avoiding shared needles or other drug paraphernalia.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the levels?</h2>
<p>Timing of testing relative to exposure and infection can affect the levels of antibodies or antigens detected.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the modifiable and non-modifiable factors that can affect Hepatitis A and B
    infections?</h2>
<p>Modifiable factors include lifestyle choices such as drug use, sexual behavior, and vaccination status.
    Non-modifiable factors include age, genetic factors, and being born to a mother with hepatitis B.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should one consult in case of an abnormal value?</h2>
<p>If you have abnormal results, you should consult a hepatologist or an infectious disease specialist for further
    evaluation and treatment.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can Hepatitis A or B become chronic?</h2>
<p>Hepatitis A does not become chronic. Hepatitis B, on the other hand, can become chronic, especially if infected at a
    young age.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I get vaccinated for Hepatitis A and B?</h2>
<p>Yes, vaccines are available for both Hepatitis A and B. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent these
    infections.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the difference between IgM and IgG antibodies?</h2>
<p>IgM antibodies are the first to be produced by the body in response to an infection, indicating a current or recent
    infection. IgG antibodies are produced later and indicate past infection or immunity.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the Hepatitis Panel - Acute Screen-I test performed?</h2>
<p>The test is performed using a blood sample. The blood is usually drawn from a vein in your arm.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do positive results mean?</h2>
<p>A positive result indicates that you are currently or were recently infected with Hepatitis A or B.</p>
<p>The Hepatitis Panel - Acute Screen-I is a vital tool in diagnosing and managing Hepatitis A and
    B infections. Timely testing can lead to appropriate treatment, minimizing complications, and helping prevent the
    spread of these viruses. Consult with your healthcare provider for more information about this test and how it fits
    into your overall health plan.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I take this test if I'm pregnant?</h2>
<p>Yes, the Hepatitis Panel - Acute Screen-I is safe to take during pregnancy. In fact, screening
    for Hepatitis B is routine in prenatal care because the virus can be passed to the baby during childbirth.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are some signs and symptoms that would prompt me to take this test?</h2>
<p>Common symptoms of Hepatitis A and B include fatigue, poor appetite, stomach pain, nausea, and
    jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). However, many people with Hepatitis, especially chronic Hepatitis B, may
    not have symptoms.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with this test?</h2>
<p>The test involves drawing blood, which may cause slight pain and a risk of infection at the
    puncture site. However, these risks are minimal, and the test is considered very safe.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the Hepatitis Panel - Acute Screen-I diagnose other types of Hepatitis?</h2>
<p>No, this panel specifically tests for Hepatitis A and B. Other tests are needed to diagnose
    Hepatitis C, D, E, etc.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How reliable are the results of the Hepatitis Panel - Acute Screen-I?</h2>
<p>The test is highly reliable when conducted in a certified laboratory by experienced
    professionals. However, it's essential to discuss the results with your doctor, as false positives and negatives can
    occur.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any treatments available if I test positive for Hepatitis A or B?</h2>
<p>Yes, treatments are available. For Hepatitis A, rest and supportive care are typically
    sufficient as the body clears the virus. For Hepatitis B, antiviral medications can help slow down the virus and
    prevent liver damage.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test distinguish between an active infection and a past infection?</h2>
<p>Yes, this test can differentiate between a current and a past infection. The presence of IgM
    antibodies indicates a recent or active infection, while the presence of IgG antibodies signifies a past infection
    or immunity.</p>
