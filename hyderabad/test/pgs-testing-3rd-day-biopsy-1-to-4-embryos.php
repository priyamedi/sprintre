<div class="post-text">
<p>Preimplantation Genetic Screening (PGS), or Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Aneuploidies (PGT-A), is a specialized diagnostic procedure used in conjunction with IVF. PGS is conducted on embryos before their transfer to the uterus. The primary aim of PGS is to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy by ensuring that only genetically normal embryos are used.</p>
<p>On the third day after fertilization, when each embryo should be at the 6-8 cell stage, a biopsy can be performed. One or two cells are taken from each embryo for genetic testing, a procedure which does not harm the embryo. These cell(s) are then evaluated to determine whether the correct number of chromosomes - 23 pairs - is present. Embryos with the right number of chromosomes have the highest chances of leading to a successful pregnancy.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is PGS Testing important?</h2>
<p>PGS Testing is essential in identifying any genetic abnormalities in embryos before they are implanted into the
    uterus. This increases the chances of a successful pregnancy and reduces the risk of miscarriage or genetic
    disorders.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the PGS Testing conducted?</h2>
<p>In PGS Testing, a small sample of cells is taken from each embryo for genetic testing. This happens on the third day
    post-fertilization when the embryo is at the 6-8 cell stage. The cells are then examined in a lab to check for the
    correct number of chromosomes.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What can PGS Testing detect?</h2>
<p>PGS Testing can identify chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), Edward’s syndrome (Trisomy
    18), Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13), and others. It can also recognize any missing or additional chromosomes which
    could result in miscarriage or birth defects.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the risks associated with PGS Testing?</h2>
<p>The risks associated with PGS Testing are minimal. However, there is a small chance that the embryo could be damaged
    during the biopsy process, but this is extremely rare with experienced practitioners.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What if my PGS results show abnormalities?</h2>
<p>If your PGS results indicate abnormalities, your healthcare provider will discuss the results with you and explain
    your options. These could include using a different embryo for implantation, considering the use of donor eggs or
    sperm, or considering options like adoption or surrogacy.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Does PGS Testing guarantee a successful pregnancy?</h2>
<p>While PGS Testing significantly increases the chances of a successful pregnancy by identifying healthy embryos, it
    does not guarantee one. Other factors, like the age and overall health of the mother, also play a significant role.
</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can PGS Testing help prevent miscarriages?</h2>
<p>PGS Testing can reduce the risk of miscarriages by ensuring that only embryos without chromosomal abnormalities are
    transferred to the uterus. However, it can't prevent all miscarriages as other factors might also contribute.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is PGS Testing right for me?</h2>
<p>PGS Testing could be recommended if you've had recurrent miscarriages, unsuccessful IVF cycles, or if you're of
    advanced maternal age. It's a personal decision that should be discussed with your healthcare provider.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How accurate is PGS Testing?</h2>
<p>PGS Testing is highly accurate in detecting chromosomal abnormalities. However, like all tests, there is a small
    chance of false positives or negatives.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How should I prepare for PGS Testing?</h2>
<p>There is no specific preparation for PGS Testing. It is a part of the IVF process. However, regular communication
    with your healthcare provider during your IVF cycle is essential.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can PGS Testing determine the sex of the baby?</h2>
<p>Yes, since PGS testing analyzes the chromosomes of the embryos, it can determine the sex of the baby. However, using
    PGS for gender selection raises ethical considerations and may not be allowed in all jurisdictions.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can PGS Testing diagnose all genetic disorders?</h2>
<p>While PGS Testing can detect many chromosomal abnormalities, it cannot diagnose all genetic disorders. Some genetic
    diseases are caused by single gene mutations that are not detectable by PGS.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can PGS Testing damage the embryo?</h2>
<p>The risk of damaging the embryo during PGS Testing is extremely low. The procedure is done by experienced
    practitioners and does not harm the embryo's potential to develop into a healthy baby.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can medications affect the PGS Testing results?</h2>
<p>No, medications do not affect PGS Testing results. The test analyzes the chromosomes in the embryo's cells, which are
    not influenced by medications.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required for PGS Testing?</h2>
<p>No, fasting is not required for PGS Testing. The test is part of the IVF process and involves analyzing the embryo's
    cells, not the patient's blood or urine.</p>
<p>Choosing to undergo PGS as part of your IVF cycle is a personal decision that should be
    carefully considered with your healthcare provider. By selecting embryos free of chromosomal abnormalities, PGS can
    potentially increase the chances of a successful pregnancy and reduce the risk of miscarriage or birth defects.
    However, PGS does not guarantee a successful pregnancy, and other factors also need to be considered.</p>
