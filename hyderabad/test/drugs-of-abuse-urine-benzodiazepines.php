<div class="post-text">
<p> Benzodiazepines are a class of medications that are widely used to treat conditions such as anxiety,
insomnia, seizures, and muscle spasms. They work by depressing the central nervous system, making
them effective tranquilizers. While these medications can be extremely beneficial for those with
legitimate medical needs, they are also sometimes abused due to their sedative effects. Some
commonly prescribed benzodiazepines include diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), and lorazepam
(Ativan).</p>
<p> The Drugs Of Abuse - Urine: Benzodiazepines test is designed to detect the presence of
benzodiazepines in the urine. This test is commonly used in the context of drug rehabilitation programs,
workplace testing, or in circumstances where benzodiazepine abuse is suspected.</p>
