<div class="post-text">
<p>While being a nutritious and healthy vegetable, broccoli is also a potential source of food allergies for some individuals. This cruciferous vegetable is packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Yet, a small fraction of the population may have an adverse immune response to certain proteins present in broccoli, leading to an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Broccoli test is designed to identify if a person has an allergy to broccoli. This is determined by measuring the levels of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies present in the blood. These antibodies are produced by the immune system when it falsely identifies broccoli proteins as harmful substances.</p>

</p>
