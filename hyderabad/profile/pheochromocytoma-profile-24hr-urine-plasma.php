						<p>The Pheochromocytoma Profile is a comprehensive set of tests that measure the levels of certain hormones in your urine and blood. These hormones, including adrenaline, nor-adrenaline, metanephrine, nor-metanephrine, and VMA, are produced by your adrenal glands. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal glands that can cause an overproduction of these hormones.</p>
						<p>Understanding the results of this test can be particularly useful in managing your health. It can help your doctor confirm a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, understand the severity of the condition, and guide treatment decisions.</p>
