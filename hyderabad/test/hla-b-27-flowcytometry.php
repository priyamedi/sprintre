<h1 class="test-h1">HLA B-27 – Flowcytometry </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p><strong>Human Leukocyte Antigen B27 (HLA-B27)</strong> is a protein located on the surface of your white blood cells. The HLA-B27 test identifies the presence of this specific protein. An HLA-B27 test is often used to support a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or other autoimmune conditions. The flow cytometry method is a powerful tool used to measure the physical and chemical characteristics of HLA-B27 protein in a population of cells. It involves the use of a beam of light, usually from a laser, which is directed onto a hydrodynamically-focused stream of fluid that carries a cell or particle suspension through it.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is an HLA-B27 test performed? </h2>
	<p>An <strong>HLA-B27 test</strong> may be recommended by your doctor if you have signs or <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/symptoms"><b style="color:#2C53A5">symptoms</b></a> suggestive of an autoimmune disorder, particularly ankylosing spondylitis or reactive arthritis. The test can provide supportive evidence for these diagnoses.
 </p>
	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does a positive result mean? </h2>
	<p>A positive result indicates the presence of the HLA-B27 protein in your blood cells. While this protein is found in a small percentage of the general population, it is significantly more common in individuals with certain autoimmune conditions like ankylosing spondylitis.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is the HLA-B27 test diagnostic?</h2>
<p>While a positive HLA-B27 test supports the diagnosis of certain conditions, it is not definitive on its own. Not all individuals with a positive HLA-B27 will develop these conditions, and some may have these conditions without a positive HLA-B27. The test results must be interpreted in conjunction with your symptoms, clinical history, and other test results.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the test performed?</h2>
<p>The HLA-B27 test using flow cytometry involves taking a blood sample, which is then prepared and stained with fluorescent markers that bind to the HLA-B27 protein. The sample is then passed through a laser beam inside a flow cytometer. The laser excites the fluorescent markers, allowing the detection and quantification of HLA-B27 positive cells.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is there any risk associated with the test?</h2>
<p>The <strong>HLA-B27 test</strong> using flow cytometry is a safe procedure. The main risk involves the blood draw required to obtain the sample, which may cause slight pain, bruising, or bleeding at the site of the needle insertion. Severe complications are rare.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What can affect the test results?</h2>
<p>The accuracy of flow cytometry can be affected by various factors, including the quality of the sample, the efficiency of the staining procedure, and the settings of the flow cytometer. It is crucial that the test is performed in a specialized laboratory by trained professionals to ensure accurate results.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I have a positive HLA-B27 and not have any disease?</h2>
<p>Yes, it's possible. Some individuals have the HLA-B27 protein but never develop an associated disease.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">I have a positive HLA-B27, does it mean my children will have it too?</h2>
<p>HLA-B27 is inherited, so there's a chance your children may also have this antigen. However, not everyone who has HLA-B27 develops health problems.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How do I prepare for the test?</h2>
<p>No specific preparation is needed for the HLA-B27 test.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the HLA-B27 test be performed on children?</h2>
<p>Yes, the <strong>HLA-B27 test</strong> can be performed on individuals of any age if indicated by their symptoms and medical history.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Does a negative HLA-B27 test rule out autoimmune diseases?</h2>
<p>No, a negative test doesn't rule out the possibility of autoimmune diseases. There are many other factors and tests that are considered when diagnosing these conditions.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How long does it take to get the results?</h2>
<p>Typically, the results are available within 1-3 days after the test.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What other tests might be performed alongside HLA-B27?</h2>
<p>Depending on your symptoms and medical history, other tests may be conducted, such as <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/hyderabad/test/rheumatoid-factor-quantitative-serum"><b style="color:#2C53A5">rheumatoid factor (RF)</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/hyderabad/test/anti-cyclic-citrullinated-peptide"><b style="color:#2C53A5">anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP)</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/hyderabad/test/erythrocyte-sedimentation-rate"><b style="color:#2C53A5">erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)</b></a>, or <a href="https://www.sprintdiagnostics.in/hyderabad/test/c-reactive-protein-quantitative-test"><b style="color:#2C53A5">C-reactive protein (CRP)</b></a>.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does it mean if my HLA-B27 test results are borderline?</h2>
<p>Borderline results are usually considered inconclusive, and the test may need to be repeated or additional testing may be required.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can HLA-B27 be linked to other conditions?</h2>
<p>Yes, aside from ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis, HLA-B27 is also linked to other conditions like psoriatic arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and certain eye disorders like uveitis.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the principle behind the flow cytometry method in HLA-B27 testing?</h2>
<p>Flow cytometry works on the principle of light scattering, fluorescence emission and fluidics. In HLA-B27 testing, cells from a blood sample are stained with fluorescent markers that bind specifically to HLA-B27 protein. When the sample flows through a laser beam within the flow cytometer, the fluorescent markers emit light which is captured and analyzed to determine the presence and quantity of HLA-B27 positive cells.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is flow cytometry the only method to test for HLA-B27?</h2>
<p>No, there are other methods available as well such as serology or molecular testing like PCR. The choice of method depends on various factors like availability, turnaround time, cost, and clinical requirement.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is there any treatment if I test positive for HLA-B27?</h2>
<p>The presence of HLA-B27 itself doesn't require treatment. It's the associated conditions that might need treatment. If you test positive for HLA-B27 and have symptoms of related conditions, your healthcare provider will guide you on the suitable treatment options.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can diet or lifestyle influence the HLA-B27 test result?</h2>
<p>No, your diet or lifestyle does not influence the <strong>HLA-B27 test</strong> results. HLA-B27 is a genetic marker that you inherit from your parents.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any limitations to the HLA-B27 test using flow cytometry?</h2>
<p>While flow cytometry is a powerful technique for HLA-B27 testing, it does have certain limitations. For example, it may not differentiate between weakly and strongly positive cells, and it requires a relatively high cell count. Furthermore, the interpretation of results requires considerable expertise.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the HLA-B27 test result change over time?</h2>
<p>No, the HLA-B27 status does not change over time as it is determined by your genes. However, the clinical manifestations associated with HLA-B27 may change or progress over time.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can HLA-B27 testing be done during pregnancy?</h2>
<p>Yes, HLA-B27 testing can be done during pregnancy if indicated. If you are pregnant and have symptoms suggestive of conditions associated with HLA-B27, your doctor may recommend this test.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is the HLA-B27 test covered by insurance?</h2>
<p>Coverage for the HLA-B27 test will depend on your specific insurance plan. It's best to check with your insurance provider to understand your coverage for this test.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test be done at home?</h2>
<p>No, the HLA-B27 test using flow cytometry is a complex procedure that requires specialized equipment and expertise. It can only be performed in a properly equipped laboratory.</p>

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can I understand my HLA-B27 test results?</h2>
<p>Your healthcare provider will help you understand the results of your <strong>HLA-B27 test</strong> in the context of your overall health, symptoms, and medical history. A positive test doesn't necessarily mean you have a disease, and a negative test doesn't completely rule out a condition. Your doctor will interpret the test results along with other clinical information for a complete diagnosis.</p>
