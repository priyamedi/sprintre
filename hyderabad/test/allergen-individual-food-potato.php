<div class="post-text">
<p>Potatoes are a common staple food consumed worldwide. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrates. While potatoes are a nutritional and versatile food for many, some individuals have an allergic reaction to potatoes. This is due to an abnormal response of the immune system to the proteins found in potatoes. Potato allergy is relatively rare compared to other food allergies but can cause a range of symptoms from mild to severe.</p>
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Potato test is a diagnostic tool that helps determine if an individual is allergic to potatoes. This blood test measures the levels of specific antibodies called Immunoglobulin E (IgE) that are produced in response to proteins in potatoes.
