<div class="post-text">
<p>Albumin is a protein that is normally found in the blood. A 24-hour urine albumin test is a urine test that measures the amount of albumin in your urine over 24 hours. Albumin is a protein made by the liver that the body needs for tissue growth and healing. It's also the protein in your blood that helps keep fluid in your bloodstream so it doesn't leak into other tissues.
 </p>
<p>An abnormal amount of albumin in your urine, known as albuminuria, might indicate kidney disease. The kidneys are supposed to filter out waste from the blood, leaving proteins and other needed nutrients. When the kidneys aren't functioning properly, albumin and other proteins can leak into the urine.

	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is the Albumin - 24 hours Urine test accurate?</h2>
