<div class="post-text">
<p>Hirsutism is a condition that causes excessive hair growth in women in areas where hair is normally minimal or absent. It's caused by an overproduction or increased sensitivity to androgens (male hormones) in the body. The Hirsutism Evaluation Panel III is a comprehensive blood test that measures the levels of various hormones involved in hair growth and regulation.</p>

<p>The panel includes tests for DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone), DHEA-S (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate), Serum Testosterone (Total and Free), LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin), 17 Hydroxyprogesterone, Androstenedione, FAI (Free Androgen Index), and DHT (Dihydrotestosterone). These tests can help to pinpoint the underlying cause of hirsutism, guide treatment decisions, and monitor the effectiveness of treatment.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is this test done?</h2>
<p>This test is primarily used to determine the cause of hirsutism, a condition that causes excessive hair growth in
    women. It can help to diagnose conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), adrenal gland disorders, and other
    hormonal imbalances.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the test performed?</h2>
<p>The test involves a simple blood draw. A healthcare professional will collect a blood sample from a vein in your arm
    using a small needle. The sample is then sent to a lab for analysis.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Do I need to fast for this test?</h2>
<p>No, fasting is not required for this test. You can eat and drink as usual before the test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is DHEA and DHEA-S?</h2>
<p>DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) and DHEA-S (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) are hormones produced by the adrenal
    glands. They can be converted into other hormones, including testosterone and estrogen. High levels of DHEA and
    DHEA-S can cause symptoms like hirsutism.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the role of testosterone in this test?</h2>
<p>Testosterone is a male hormone, but it's also produced in small amounts in women. The test measures both the total
    testosterone (the overall level of testosterone in your body) and free testosterone (the testosterone available for
    your body to use). Elevated levels of testosterone in women can contribute to hirsutism.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is LH and FSH?</h2>
<p>LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) are hormones produced by the pituitary gland. They
    play important roles in the menstrual cycle and reproduction. Imbalances in LH and FSH can contribute to conditions
    like PCOS, which can cause hirsutism.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is 17 Hydroxyprogesterone?</h2>
<p>17 Hydroxyprogesterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands and the ovaries. It's a precursor to other
    hormones, including cortisol and progesterone. High levels of 17 Hydroxyprogesterone can be a sign of an adrenal
    gland disorder, which can cause hirsutism.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is Androstenedione?</h2>
<p>Androstenedione is a hormone that can be converted into testosterone and estrogen. High levels of androstenedione can
    lead to an excess of male hormones and contribute to hirsutism.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the Free Androgen Index (FAI)?</h2>
<p>The Free Androgen Index (FAI) is a calculation based on the levels of total testosterone and SHBG (Sex Hormone
    Binding Globulin) in your blood. It provides an estimate of the amount of testosterone available for your body to
    use. A high FAI can be a sign of an androgen excess, which can contribute to hirsutism.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)?</h2>
<p>DHT (Dihydrotestosterone) is a powerful male hormone that's produced from testosterone. High levels of DHT can lead
    to an increase in body hair and contribute to hirsutism.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do the test results mean?</h2>
<p>High levels of the hormones tested in this panel can indicate an androgen excess, which can cause hirsutism. The
    specific hormones that are elevated can help to identify the underlying cause of the excess hair growth. For
    example, high levels of DHEA and 17 Hydroxyprogesterone can indicate an adrenal gland disorder, while an elevated
    FAI can be a sign of PCOS.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can this test be done at home?</h2>
<p>No, this test requires a blood draw, which should be performed by a healthcare professional. It's important to have
    the test done in a medical setting to ensure the accuracy of the results.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I get tested?</h2>
<p>The frequency of testing will depend on your symptoms, medical history, and the underlying condition causing the
    hirsutism. Your doctor will provide guidance on how often you should get tested.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can medication affect the test results?</h2>
<p>Yes, certain medications can affect hormone levels and the results of this test. It's important to inform your
    healthcare provider about all the medications, supplements, and herbal products you are taking.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What happens if the test results are abnormal?</h2>
<p>Abnormal test results can indicate a hormonal imbalance or an underlying condition causing hirsutism. Depending on
    the results, your doctor may recommend further testing, refer you to a specialist, or start treatment to manage the
    condition and alleviate your symptoms.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can lifestyle changes affect the hormone levels measured in this test?</h2>
<p>Yes, certain lifestyle factors can affect hormone levels. For instance, maintaining a healthy weight can help
    regulate hormone levels as being overweight can increase the levels of certain hormones, such as insulin, which in
    turn can increase the production of androgens. Regular physical activity can also help maintain balanced hormone
    levels.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are the hormone levels measured in this test affected by the menstrual cycle?</h2>
<p>Some hormones measured in this test, like LH, FSH, and certain androgens, can fluctuate during the menstrual cycle.
    It's crucial to discuss your menstrual cycle with your healthcare provider, who may recommend the best time in your
    cycle to have this test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Who can order this test?</h2>
<p>This test is typically ordered by your primary care physician or a specialist such as an endocrinologist or
    gynecologist, especially if you exhibit symptoms like excessive hair growth, acne, irregular periods, or weight
    gain.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are the hormone levels measured in this test affected by age?</h2>
<p>Yes, hormone levels can change with age. For example, testosterone levels may decrease with age in both men and
    women. It's essential to discuss age-related changes with your healthcare provider when interpreting the results of
    this test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can I prepare for the test?</h2>
<p>You don’t need to do anything special to prepare for this test. Just continue your usual diet and routine, unless
    your healthcare provider instructs you otherwise. Be sure to tell your doctor about any medications or supplements
    you’re taking.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Hirsutism Evaluation Panel III offers valuable insights into the hormonal
    balance in your body and can help diagnose the underlying cause of hirsutism. Understanding your results, in context
    with your symptoms and lifestyle factors, can guide appropriate treatment and improve your quality of life. Always
    consult with your healthcare provider to discuss your results, potential treatments, and any further testing that
    may be necessary.</p>
