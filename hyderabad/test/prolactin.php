<h1 class="test-h1">Prolactin </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>The prolactin test is a blood test that measures the level of the hormone prolactin in your blood. Prolactin is produced by your pituitary gland, a small bean-shaped gland located at the base of your brain. This hormone plays a critical role in various bodily functions, most notably in the production of breast milk in women following childbirth, regulation of menstrual periods, and sex drive in both men and women.</p>

<p>Understanding the levels of prolactin in your body is essential as abnormal prolactin levels may indicate several conditions such as pituitary disorders, hypothalamus disorders, and kidney disease, among others. By routinely monitoring your prolactin levels, you can stay informed about your hormonal health and make educated decisions with your healthcare provider.</p>
