							<p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis is a non-invasive diagnostic
								procedure that uses a combination of a large magnet, radio frequencies, and a computer
								to produce detailed images of organs and structures inside the abdomen and pelvis. The
								organs that can be seen during an MRI of the abdomen include the liver, pancreas,
								gallbladder, and kidneys. The pelvic organs include the bladder, prostate or uterus, and
								ovaries.
							</p>
							<p>
								This diagnostic procedure is invaluable as it gives the doctors a detailed view inside
								the body which can be used for a plethora of purposes such as diagnosing, monitoring,
								and planning treatments for various conditions.
							</p>
							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Specific Instructions:</h2>
							<ul>

								<li>
									<p> <strong>Fasting : </strong> It is common to be asked to fast for at least 6 hours
										before the scan to reduce any movement in the stomach and intestines which could
										blur the images.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> <strong>Allergies and Medical History : </strong> If you are allergic to any
										medicines or food, or have any medical condition, especially kidney problems,
										it’s important to inform the doctor as sometimes a contrast material is used.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> <strong>Metal Objects : </strong> It is crucial to remove all metal objects,
										including jewelry and eyeglasses, as the MRI uses a strong magnet.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> <strong>Clothing : </strong> Wear comfortable and loose-fitting clothes. You
										might have to wear a gown during the procedure.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p> <strong>Claustrophobia : </strong> If you have claustrophobia, you should inform
										the doctor beforehand as the MRI machine is an enclosed space.</p>
								</li>

							</ul>



							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the process of getting an MRI of the Abdomen and Pelvis?
							</h2>
							<p>During the MRI, you will be asked to lie on a sliding table. This table slides into the
								tunnel-like structure of the MRI machine. The machine can be quite loud and you may be
								given earplugs or headphones. It's crucial to remain as still as possible during the
								examination to ensure clear images. The process usually takes between 30 minutes to an
								hour.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the importance of this test?</h2>
							<p>An MRI of the abdomen and pelvis can be used to diagnose and monitor various conditions
								such as tumors, inflammatory diseases, obstructions, and other disorders. It's
								particularly beneficial for viewing soft tissues.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is fasting required?</h2>
							<p>Yes, patients are generally asked to fast for at least 6 hours before the examination.
							</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any risks associated with an MRI of the Abdomen and

								for people with some metal implants. The use of a contrast agent can also pose risks for
								people with kidney issues.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What information does it give?</h2>
							<p>This test provides detailed images of soft tissues, organs, and other structures in the
								abdomen and pelvis. It can show the presence of tumors, cysts, fluid collections, and
								infections.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done?</h2>
							<p>The frequency of this test depends on the medical condition being monitored or diagnosed.
								Your doctor will provide guidance on how often you need this test.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are some precautions one should take?</h2>

								doctor of any medical conditions or allergies.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values?</h2>
							<p>Normal findings are healthy organs without any tumors, cysts or other abnormalities.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors affect the values?</h2>
							<p>The quality of the images and the results can be affected by movement during the test or
								the presence of metal within the body.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should be consulted in case of abnormal findings?</h2>
							<p>If there are abnormal findings, you should consult with the doctor who ordered the MRI.
								Depending on the findings, you may be referred to a gastroenterologist, urologist, or
								another specialist.</p>

							</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is a contrast MRI of the Abdomen and Pelvis?</h2>
							<p>A contrast MRI involves injecting a dye into the veins which can make certain areas more
								visible. This is particularly useful in certain cases to view blood vessels or to
								highlight certain areas of the organs.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How should one prepare for an MRI of the Abdomen and Pelvis?</h2>
							<p>Apart from fasting, it's important to follow all the instructions given by the healthcare
								facility. This might include arriving early, wearing suitable clothing, and making sure
								to follow all the steps outlined in the specific instructions.</p>
							<p>Having an MRI of the Abdomen and Pelvis is a valuable tool for diagnosing and monitoring
								various health conditions. While the procedure is generally considered to be safe, it's
								important to follow all the instructions provided by your healthcare provider. In case
								of any doubts or concerns, don't hesitate to discuss them with your doctor.</p>
