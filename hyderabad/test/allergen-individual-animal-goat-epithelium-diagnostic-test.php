								<p>The Allergen, Individual - Animal Goat Epithelium Diagnostic Test is a critical test to identify whether an individual has an allergic reaction to goat epithelium. This test measures the levels of specific antibodies in the blood that are produced when the immune system responds to exposure to goat epithelium. It is particularly useful for people who often interact with goats, such as farmers or those who live in rural environments where goats are common.</p>
								<p>Allergies are an overreaction of the immune system to substances that are usually harmless, like goat epithelium. When your body encounters an allergen, it reacts by producing antibodies against it. This reaction can result in symptoms that range from mild, such as itching or sneezing, to severe and potentially life-threatening.</p>
