								<p>The Allergen, Individual - Animal Guinea Pig Epithelium Diagnostic Test is an essential test for determining an allergic reaction to guinea pig epithelium. The test measures specific antibodies present in the blood produced in response to exposure to guinea pig epithelium. It is particularly valuable for individuals who keep guinea pigs as pets, or who are in regular contact with these animals.</p>
								<p>Allergies are an immune system's exaggerated response to substances, like guinea pig epithelium, that are typically harmless. The body's immune response to these allergens leads to the production of specific antibodies, which result in a series of reactions that cause symptoms ranging from mild (like sneezing and itching) to severe, which could be life-threatening.</p>

						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What information does the test provide?</h2>
						<p>The test identifies and measures the levels of specific IgE antibodies in your blood. These antibodies are produced by your immune system in response to guinea pig epithelium. Higher than normal levels can indicate an allergic reaction to guinea pig epithelium.</p>

						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should this test be done?</h2>
						<p>This test is generally done when symptoms suggest an allergy. The frequency of retesting depends on how well symptoms are managed and exposure levels. Your doctor will provide guidance based on your individual circumstances.</p>

						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values?</h2>
						<p>Normal values typically indicate low levels of specific IgE antibodies. These levels can vary among labs and testing methods. Your lab report should include the specific reference range for your test.</p>

						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should I take before and after the test?</h2>
						<p>There are no specific precautions required for this test. However, if you're diagnosed with a guinea pig epithelium allergy, your doctor will suggest suitable measures like avoiding exposure to guinea pigs or using prescribed medications to manage the allergy.</p>

						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the levels of guinea pig epithelium allergen in my body?</h2>
						<p>The primary factor affecting guinea pig epithelium allergen levels is exposure to guinea pigs or guinea pig epithelium. Modifiable factors include maintaining cleanliness in your surroundings and limiting direct contact with guinea pigs. Non-modifiable factors could be a genetic predisposition to allergies.</p>

						<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Which doctor should I consult if my test value is abnormal?</h2>
