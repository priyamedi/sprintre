							<p>The Food Fx 5 Allergy Panel is specifically designed to screen for common food allergies
								in infants. This test checks for specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood
								that respond to certain foods - egg white, cod fish, wheat, peanut, soybean, and cow
								milk. By analyzing the presence and levels of these antibodies, it is possible to
								identify potential allergies and hypersensitivity to these food items. </p>
							<p>Food allergies in infants are quite common and can cause a range of symptoms from mild
								discomfort to severe allergic reactions. It's crucial for parents and caregivers to
								identify these allergens early to manage the child's diet and prevent potential harm.
								This test serves as a reliable tool in providing a clear picture of an infant's allergic
								profile. </p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the Food Fx 5 Allergy Panel for Infants?</h2>
								<p>The Food Fx 5 Allergy Panel is a blood test for infants that checks for potential
									allergies to common food items like egg white, cod fish, wheat, peanut, soybean, and
									cow milk.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Do I need to prepare my baby in any way for this test?</h2>
								<p>No special preparations are required for this test. Just ensure your baby is
									comfortable and calm at the time of the blood sample collection.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does the test measure?</h2>
								<p>This test measures specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood that
									respond to certain foods. An elevated level of these antibodies suggests an allergic
									reaction to the respective food item.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should my infant get this test?</h2>
								<p>This would largely depend on the advice of your doctor. However, if your infant
									frequently exhibits symptoms of food allergies, the doctor may recommend regular
									allergy testing.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
								<p>Normal values may vary from lab to lab. Generally, a low level or absence of specific
									IgE antibodies against the tested foods is considered normal.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What do abnormal test results mean?</h2>
								<p>An abnormal test result indicates that your baby is likely allergic to one or more of
									the tested foods. High levels of specific IgE antibodies correspond to an allergic
									reaction to that particular food item.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can certain factors influence the results of this test?</h2>
								<p>Yes, factors like recent exposure to the food items, medication, and the overall
									health condition of your baby can affect the results. Always discuss any medication
									or health concerns with the doctor before the test.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should I take before this test?</h2>
								<p>There are no specific precautions to be taken before this test. Just ensure that your
									baby is comfortable and calm.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the modifiable factors that can affect the results of
									this test?</h2>
								<p>The primary modifiable factor affecting the results of this test is your baby's diet.
									If your baby has been exposed to the tested food items before the test, their body
									might produce specific IgE antibodies, potentially affecting the results.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the non-modifiable factors that can affect the test
									results?</h2>
								<p>Non-modifiable factors include your baby's genetic predisposition to allergies. If
									there's a family history of food allergies, your baby might be more prone to
									developing them.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Which doctor should I consult if my baby's test results are
									abnormal?</h2>
								<p>You should consult a pediatric allergist or a pediatrician if your baby's test
									results are abnormal. They can guide you on the necessary steps to manage your
									baby's food allergies.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Are food allergies in infants common?</h2>
								<p>Yes, food allergies in infants are quite common. The foods tested in this panel are
									some of the most common allergens for infants.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What symptoms might my baby show if they have a food allergy?
								</h2>
								<p>Symptoms of food allergies in infants can vary from mild to severe and may include
									hives, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing, or a sudden
									drop in blood pressure.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can I take this test at home?</h2>
								<p>No, this test requires a blood sample to be taken by a healthcare professional in a
									clinical setting.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the role of total IgE in this test?</h2>
								<p>Total IgE levels give a broader view of the immune system's response to allergens. A
									high total IgE level might indicate an allergic condition, but it is not specific to
									any particular allergen.</p>
								<p>In the face of an emerging food allergy in your infant, early detection can
									facilitate effective management and avoidance strategies. An allergic reaction in an
									infant might lead to discomfort, agitation, and in severe cases, life-threatening
									conditions. Hence, it's prudent to get your infant tested if they exhibit any signs
									of food allergy. Always consult a doctor for advice based on the results. Regular
									monitoring and careful dietary management can ensure the health and happiness of
									your baby.</p>
