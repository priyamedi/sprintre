						<div class="post-text">
							<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Green Pepper test is a diagnostic test used to determine
								if an individual is allergic to green peppers. Green peppers are a common food
								ingredient in many cuisines and diets around the world. However, for some individuals,
								consuming green peppers can trigger an allergic reaction, ranging from mild to severe.
							</p>
							<p>
								This diagnostic test works by detecting specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in
								the blood. When the immune system mistakenly identifies a substance as harmful, such as
								green pepper proteins, it responds by producing specific IgE antibodies. These
								antibodies are what healthcare providers look for as an indication of an allergic
								reaction.
