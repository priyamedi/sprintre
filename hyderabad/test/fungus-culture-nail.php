<div class="post-text">
<p>Fungus Culture [Nail] is a laboratory test used to detect and identify fungal infections in the nails. These infections, known as onychomycosis, occur when fungi invade the nails and the skin under the nails. Fungal nail infections are common and can affect both fingernails and toenails. They usually begin as a small spot and gradually cause the nail to become discolored, thick, and potentially brittle. The Fungus Culture test involves collecting a small sample of the nail, typically a clipping or scraping, and cultivating it in a laboratory environment conducive to fungal growth. This allows for the identification of the specific fungus causing the infection, which is crucial for effective treatment.
