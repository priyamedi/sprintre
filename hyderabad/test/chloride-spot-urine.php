<div class="post-text">
<p>The Chloride - Spot Urine test measures the amount of chloride in a urine sample collected at a random time of day. Chloride is a type of electrolyte that helps regulate the amount of fluids in the body and maintain the acid-base balance. Abnormal levels of chloride in the urine can be indicative of various health conditions, including kidney disease, certain hormonal disorders, or problems related to dehydration or overhydration.
