<div class="post-text">
<p>IgG, or Immunoglobulin G, is the most common type of antibody found in the bloodstream. It plays a pivotal role in fighting bacterial and viral infections. The Immunoglobulin G, IgG - Serum test is used to measure the level of IgG in your blood. It can provide valuable insights into the state of your immune system and help diagnose conditions such as immunodeficiency disorders, autoimmune diseases, and infections</p>
<p>Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are proteins produced by the immune system to combat harmful substances like viruses, bacteria, and toxins. The IgG class of antibodies constitutes about 70-80% of all the antibodies in the body, making it a key component of the body's defense mechanism.</p>
<p>The Immunoglobulin G, IgG - Serum test is typically ordered when a person presents with recurrent infections or symptoms suggesting an immunodeficiency disorder. It is also performed when a doctor suspects an autoimmune disease, a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells.</p>
