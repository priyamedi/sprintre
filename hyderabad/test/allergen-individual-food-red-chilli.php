<div class="post-text">
<p>Red chili peppers are a common ingredient in various cuisines around the world. They are known for adding heat and flavor to dishes. While many people enjoy the spicy kick that red chilies provide, some individuals may have an allergic reaction to them. This is generally due to the body's immune system mistakenly identifying certain proteins in red chilies as harmful.</p>
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Red Chili test is used to help in the diagnosis of red chili allergy. It measures the level of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood that are produced in response to proteins found in red chili peppers.</p>
