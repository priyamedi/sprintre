						<div>
							<p>Food allergies are a common health issue affecting a large portion of the population. One such category
of food allergies is fruit allergies. These are triggered when your immune system overreacts to proteins
found in certain fruits, treating them as harmful substances. The Allergy Screening Panel 4 Fruits is a
diagnostic test designed to identify whether you have an allergic reaction to a selection of four common
fruits.</p>
							<p>Fruit allergies can range from mild to severe, with symptoms such as itching in the mouth or throat,
hives, stomach cramps, and, in severe cases, anaphylaxis. The Allergy Screening Panel 4 Fruits test can
identify allergies to four types of fruits, such as apples, bananas, peaches, and strawberries, which are
known to commonly cause allergic reactions.This test measures the presence of specific
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood, which your immune system produces when it overreacts
to allergens in the fruits.
							</p>
							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Specific Instructions:</h2>
							<p>There is no need to fast before this test. However, it is essential to inform your doctor about any
medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as they may interfere
with the test results.</p>
<p>Additionally, avoid any exposure to known allergens before the test. If you are undergoing allergen-
specific immunotherapy, please discuss this with your doctor before the test, as it could impact the
results</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How is the Allergy Screening Panel 4 Fruits test conducted?</h2>
							<p>
The test is simple and involves a standard blood draw procedure. A healthcare professional will collect a
sample of your blood, which will then be sent to a laboratory for analysis.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What does this test measure?</h2>
<p>
This test measures the level of specific IgE antibodies in your blood. These antibodies are produced by
your immune system in response to allergens. If your blood contains IgE antibodies specific to certain
fruits, it indicates a possible allergy to those fruits.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> When should I consider taking this test?</h2>
<p>
Consider taking this test if you experience allergic symptoms after consuming certain fruits. These can
include itching in the mouth or throat, hives, stomach cramps, and, in severe cases, anaphylaxis.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How often should I get this test done?</h2>
<p>
The frequency of the test depends on your symptoms and your doctor's recommendations. If you are
undergoing treatment for fruit allergies, your doctor might suggest regular testing to monitor your
progress.
</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What precautions should I take before the test?</h2>
<p>
Inform your doctor about all the medications you are taking as some can interfere with the test results.
Avoid exposure to known allergens before the test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
<p>
Normal values can vary between laboratories. Generally, a low level or absence of specific IgE antibodies
against the tested fruits in your blood indicates you are likely not allergic to these specific fruits. Your
doctor will interpret your results based on your symptoms and medical history.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What factors can affect the test results?</h2>
<p>
The test results can be affected by medications, recent exposure to allergens, and certain health
conditions like autoimmune diseases or infections.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can I be allergic to more than one type of fruit?</h2>
<p>
Yes, it's possible to be allergic to multiple types of fruits. Your doctor can advise you on additional tests
if needed.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How can I prevent allergic reactions to these fruits?</h2>
<p>
The best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid the fruits that trigger your allergies. In case of
accidental ingestion, antihistamines or corticosteroids may be used to manage mild reactions. People
with severe allergies should carry an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) for emergency self-
administration.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Which doctor should I consult if my test results are abnormal?</h2>
<p>
If your test results are abnormal, you should consult an allergist or immunologist. They can guide you on
the necessary steps to manage your allergies effectively.</p>
<p>Understanding your body's response to specific allergens is crucial in managing allergies. The Allergy
Screening Panel 4 Fruits can help identify if certain fruits are causing your allergy symptoms, allowing
you to take appropriate measures to manage your allergies effectively. Stay informed, and take
proactive steps for your health.
