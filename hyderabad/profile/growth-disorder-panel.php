<div class="post-text">
<p>A growth disorder panel is a group of tests used to assess a child's growth and development. The panel includes tests for Human Growth Hormone (HGH), Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), and Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 (IGFBP-3). These tests are helpful in diagnosing conditions related to growth abnormalities, such as growth hormone deficiency, pituitary gland disorders, and malnutrition.</p>

<p>Human Growth Hormone (HGH), also known as somatotropin, is produced by the pituitary gland and plays a crucial role in cell growth, reproduction, and regeneration. IGF-1, produced primarily in the liver, is stimulated by HGH and plays a significant role in tissue growth and development. IGFBP-3 is the major carrier of IGF-1 in the blood and regulates its access to target tissues.</p>

<p>Imbalances in these hormones can lead to a variety of health problems, ranging from dwarfism and short stature to gigantism or acromegaly. Early detection of these imbalances can help guide effective treatment strategies, leading to better management and prognosis of the conditions.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is a Growth Disorder Panel?</h2>
<p>It's a panel of tests including Human Growth Hormone (HGH), Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), and Insulin-like
    Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 (IGFBP-3) to assess growth and development.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the Growth Disorder Panel performed?</h2>
<p>This panel helps diagnose conditions related to abnormal growth, such as growth hormone deficiency, pituitary gland
    disorders, and malnutrition.</p>
