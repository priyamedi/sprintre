<div class="post-text">
<p>Phencyclidine, commonly known as PCP, is a synthetic dissociative drug that was initially developed as an anesthetic. However, due to its severe and adverse neurological effects, it was discontinued for medical use. PCP is known for producing mind-altering effects such as hallucinations, distorted perceptions of sounds and violent behavior. It is considered a dangerous drug because it affects the central nervous system and can cause both physical and psychological harm.</p>
<p>The <b>Drugs Of Abuse - Urine: Phencyclidine (PCP)</b> test is a urine-based screening used to detect the presence of PCP in the body. It is often utilized in drug rehabilitation monitoring, workplace drug testing, and emergency cases where PCP use is suspected. Early detection of PCP in the system is vital as it can help to prevent potential damage and facilitate timely intervention and treatment.</p>
