						<div>
							<p>Tree pollen allergies are a common form of seasonal allergies, typically peaking in the spring when many
trees release their pollen. The Allergy Screening Panel Tree Pollen is a diagnostic test that checks for
allergic responses to common tree pollens.</p>
							<p>Tree pollen allergies can cause various symptoms, such as sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, runny nose,
and in severe cases, difficulty breathing. This test checks for allergies to a variety of tree pollens,
including oak, birch, maple, cedar, pine, and others.The Allergy Screening Panel Tree Pollen test checks
for specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in your blood. When your immune system identifies an
allergen, such as tree pollen, as a threat, it produces these IgE antibodies. The presence of specific IgE
antibodies indicates an allergic response.
							</p>
							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Specific Instructions:</h2>
							<p>There is no need to fast before this test. However, if you are currently taking any medications, especially
antihistamines, make sure to inform your doctor, as certain drugs may interfere with the test results. If
possible, try to avoid exposure to known allergens for several days before the test to ensure accurate
results</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How is the Allergy Screening Panel Tree Pollen test conducted?</h2>
							<p>
This test is performed using a simple blood draw. A healthcare professional will collect a blood sample,
which is then sent to a laboratory for analysis.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What does this test measure?</h2>
<p>
This test measures the level of specific IgE antibodies in your blood. These antibodies are produced by
your immune system in response to allergens like tree pollen.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> When should I consider getting this test?</h2>
<p>
If you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as sneezing, runny nose, itchy or watery eyes,
or difficulty breathing during certain times of the year, particularly in the spring, you should consider
getting this test.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How often should I get tested?</h2>
<p>
The frequency of testing depends on your symptoms and your doctor's advice. If you are undergoing
immunotherapy treatment for allergies, your doctor might recommend regular testing to monitor your
progress.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What precautions should I take before the test?</h2>
<p>
Inform your doctor about any medications you're currently taking, as they could affect the test results.
Also, try to avoid exposure to known allergens before the test.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
<p>
Normal values can vary between laboratories. Generally, a low level or absence of specific IgE antibodies
against the tested tree pollens in your blood indicates a non-allergic response to these allergens.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What factors can affect the test results?</h2>
<p>
Various factors can influence your test results, including recent exposure to allergens, certain
medications, and some health conditions like autoimmune diseases or infections.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can I be allergic to more than one type of tree pollen?</h2>
<p>
Yes, it's possible to be allergic to multiple types of tree pollens. This test can help identify which specific
tree pollens are causing your allergic reactions.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How can I prevent allergic reactions to tree pollen?</h2>
<p>
The best way to prevent allergic reactions is to avoid exposure to the triggering tree pollen. This can
include staying indoors on high pollen count days, using air purifiers, and washing your clothes and hair
after being outside.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Which doctor should I consult if my test results are abnormal?</h2>
<p>
If your test results are abnormal, you should consult an allergist or immunologist. They can help you
understand your results and guide you on the next steps.</p>
<p>Understanding your body's allergic responses to tree pollen can help you manage your allergies more
effectively. With the Allergy Screening Panel Tree Pollen, you can identify your triggers and take
proactive steps towards a healthier life, free from unnecessary allergic reactions. This knowledge can
help you make better-informed decisions about your lifestyle, diet, and medical treatments, enhancing
your quality of life and overall well-being.</p>
