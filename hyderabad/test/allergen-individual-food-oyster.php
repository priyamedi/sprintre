							<p>Oysters are a delicacy enjoyed by many around the globe, and they are known for their
								unique taste and nutritional benefits. However, some individuals may experience allergic
								reactions to oysters. The Allergen, Individual - Food Oyster test is designed to
								determine if an individual has an allergy to oysters. This blood test measures the level
								of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies produced in response to proteins present
								in oysters. Knowing if you have an oyster allergy is crucial for making informed dietary
								choices and avoiding potential allergic reactions.
