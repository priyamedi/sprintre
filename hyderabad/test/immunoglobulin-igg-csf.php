<div class="post-text">
<p>The Immunoglobulin IgG - CSF test is an analytical procedure that examines the level of IgG antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are proteins produced by the immune system to combat foreign substances like bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Among different types of immunoglobulins, IgG is the most abundant and has a crucial role in the body's immune response. This test is usually requested when a patient exhibits symptoms suggesting a neurological disorder or infection</p>
<p>CSF is a clear, colorless body fluid found in the brain and spinal cord that provides essential mechanical and immunological protection to these sensitive areas. Changes in IgG levels in the CSF can be indicative of various conditions, including infections, inflammatory diseases, or other neurological disorders. Therefore, this test plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring such conditions and assists healthcare professionals in devising the most effective treatment plan</p>
