<div class="post-text">
<p>The Allergy - Asthma / Rhinitis Screening Panel 1 - Adult test is a comprehensive screening tool to identify potential allergens that could trigger symptoms in adults who have asthma or rhinitis. This panel tests for common allergens such as ragweed, dust mites (Dermatophagoides Farinae and Dermatophagoides Pteronyssinus), fungi (Alternaria tenuis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, and Penicillium notatum), house dust, and cockroach allergens. </p>
<p>When the body identifies a harmless substance as harmful, it overreacts, triggering an allergic reaction. This can lead to a range of symptoms from mild ones such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes, to more serious ones such as difficulty breathing or anaphylaxis. Understanding which allergens trigger your symptoms is the first step towards managing and treating allergies effectively.
