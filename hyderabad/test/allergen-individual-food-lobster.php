<div class="post-text">
<p>Lobsters are marine crustaceans that are considered a delicacy by many. However, some individuals may experience an allergic reaction to lobster, which is usually caused by proteins found in the flesh of the lobster. The Allergen, Individual - Food Lobster test is designed to determine whether an individual has a sensitivity to these proteins by measuring the level of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood. </p>
<p>Having a lobster allergy can be challenging, especially for those who enjoy seafood. The symptoms of lobster allergy can range from mild to severe, and it's important for individuals who have this allergy to understand its manifestations and how to manage them. </p>
