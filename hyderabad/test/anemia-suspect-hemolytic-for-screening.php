                            <p>Hemolytic anemia is a group of blood disorders characterized by the premature destruction
                                of red blood cells (RBCs) in the body. When this occurs, the body is unable to replace
                                the RBCs at the same rate as their destruction, leading to anemia. The Anemia - Suspect
                                Hemolytic screening panel consists of a set of specific diagnostic tests, namely the
                                Coombs Test – Direct & Indirect, G6PD Quantitative, Haptoglobin, Hemogram, LDH-Serum,
                                Liver Function Tests (LFT), Osmotic Fragility Test, and Urine - Hemosiderin. These tests
                                collectively assess the functioning of the red blood cells, liver, and general blood
                                parameters.
                            </p>
                            <p>Hemolytic anemia can be either inherited (such as in conditions like sickle cell anemia
                                or thalassemia) or acquired (from certain infections, autoimmune diseases, or exposure
                                to certain drugs). Regardless of the type, the common factor is the destruction of red
                                blood cells, leading to symptoms like fatigue, paleness, shortness of breath, and
                                jaundice. Therefore, this diagnostic panel is a crucial tool in the identification and
                                management of hemolytic anemia.

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> When should these tests be done?</h2>
								<p>These tests should be done if you have symptoms of hemolytic anemia, such as fatigue,
									paleness, jaundice, dark-colored urine, or an elevated heart rate. They may also be
									ordered if your doctor suspects hemolytic anemia based on other test results.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How often should these tests be performed?</h2>
								<p>The frequency of these tests largely depends on the severity and type of hemolytic
									anemia and your overall health status. Your doctor will provide you with appropriate
									guidance.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Are there any risks associated with these tests?</h2>
								<p>The blood tests in this panel carry minimal risk, similar to any blood-drawing
									procedure. This may include slight pain, bruising or bleeding at the needle site, or
									feeling light-headed.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Do I need to fast for these tests?</h2>
								<p>No fasting is required for these tests. However, you should follow any specific
									instructions given by your healthcare professional.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What can affect the test results?</h2>
								<p>Medications, alcohol consumption, diet, and overall health status can affect these
									tests. Certain health conditions, like liver disease, inflammation, and cancer, can
									also influence the results. It's important to share your complete medical history
									with your doctor.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Which doctor should I consult if my results are abnormal?</h2>
								<p>If your test results are abnormal, it would be best to consult a hematologist, who
									specializes in diagnosing and managing blood disorders.</p>

								<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How is the test performed?</h2>
								<p>A healthcare professional will collect a blood sample from a vein, usually in your
									arm, and a urine sample. These samples will then be sent to a lab for analysis.</p>
								<p>This Anemia - Suspect Hemolytic screening panel is a comprehensive set of tests to
									identify and manage hemolytic anemia effectively. Abnormal results can guide your
									healthcare professional in creating an appropriate treatment plan for you. Regular
									monitoring and follow-up are vital for managing your symptoms and improving your
									health.</p>
