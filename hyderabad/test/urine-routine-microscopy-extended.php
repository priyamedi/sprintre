						<h1 class="test-h1">Extended Urine Routine and Microscopy Examination</h1>
							<p>The Extended Urine Routine and Microscopy Examination is a group of tests that evaluate the urinary system's function and health. It examines both the physical and microscopic attributes of urine, providing comprehensive data about renal and metabolic function, fluid balance, and urinary tract infections.
</p>
<p>This non-invasive procedure requires a urine sample, which is evaluated using a variety of tests. These include urine color, clarity, specific gravity, pH, presence of protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, and blood. The microscopic examination evaluates the presence of red and white blood cells, epithelial cells, crystals, casts, bacteria, and other components.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Specific Instructions:</h2>
							<p>The test requires a clean-catch midstream urine sample. This means that you should clean your genital area before providing the sample and collect the sample in the middle of urination, not at the beginning. This method helps prevent the sample from being contaminated by bacteria or other substances present around the urethral area. No specific dietary restrictions or fasting is required for the test, but it is essential to inform your doctor about any medications or supplements you are currently taking.</p>
