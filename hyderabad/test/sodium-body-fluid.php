<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can medications affect the test results?</h2>
<p>Certain medications, such as diuretics and corticosteroids, can affect sodium balance and potentially the test results.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does a high result mean in a Sodium - Body Fluid test?</h2>
<p>A high sodium level in body fluid could indicate dehydration or an overproduction of a hormone that helps regulate sodium and water balance.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I take steps to improve my test results?</h2>
<p>Modifications in diet or medication, as advised by your doctor, can help manage sodium levels.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">If my results are abnormal, what treatment options are available?</h2>
<p>Treatment options will depend on the cause of the abnormal sodium levels and may include medication adjustments, fluid management strategies, or treatment of an underlying condition.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are certain individuals more likely to have abnormal Sodium - Body Fluid test results?</h2>
<p>Individuals with conditions affecting fluid balance, such as heart disease, kidney disease, or liver disease, may have abnormal results.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How should I prepare for the Sodium - Body Fluid test?</h2>
<p>No special preparation is required for this test.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does it mean if my Sodium - Body Fluid test results are consistently high?</h2>
<p>Consistently high sodium levels in body fluid may suggest a chronic condition affecting fluid balance, such as heart disease, kidney disease, or liver disease.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How accurate is the Sodium - Body Fluid test?</h2>
<p>This test is generally accurate for measuring sodium levels in body fluids, but results should be interpreted in the context of other clinical findings and tests.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What other tests might my doctor order along with the Sodium - Body Fluid test?</h2>
<p>Other tests your doctor may order include other electrolyte tests, kidney function tests, or specific tests based on the type of body fluid sampled.</p>
