<div class="post-text">
<p>Selenium is a crucial trace element required by the human body for proper function. It plays a pivotal role in metabolism and thyroid function, as well as the protection against oxidative damage and infections. A Selenium, Urine Spot test helps to measure the amount of selenium in your urine. This investigation is critical for evaluating your body's selenium status and can assist in diagnosing deficiencies or toxicities related to this trace element.</p>

<p>This test is often used in conjunction with other tests to diagnose and monitor various health conditions. Selenium, although essential, can be toxic in high amounts. Monitoring your selenium level is important to ensure you are getting just the right amount - not too little, not too much. Additionally, it is also used to track selenium exposure in people who live in areas with high selenium soil concentration or work in industries that use selenium.</p>

<p>Diet is a significant modifiable factor. Foods rich in selenium include seafood, lean meats, poultry, dairy products,
    grains, onions, and garlic. However, excessive intake may lead to toxicity.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the non-modifiable factors affecting selenium levels?</h2>
<p>Geographical location and soil composition are non-modifiable factors that influence selenium levels in the foods
    grown in that soil.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Who should I consult if my test values are abnormal?</h2>
<p>If your test values are abnormal, consult your doctor who will interpret your results considering your overall health
    status and provide a suitable treatment plan.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Does this test involve any risks?</h2>
<p>The test is non-invasive and involves no significant risks. You might feel a slight discomfort during the urine
    collection process, but it subsides quickly.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can selenium levels be too high?</h2>
<p>Yes, selenium levels can be too high, leading to a condition called selenosis. Symptoms may include hair loss,
    nausea, irritability, fatigue, and mild nerve damage.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can selenium levels be too low?</h2>
<p>Yes, selenium deficiency can occur but it's rare in well-nourished individuals. It may cause problems such as male
    infertility, heart disease, and a weakened immune system.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can certain medical conditions affect selenium levels?</h2>
<p>Yes, conditions affecting nutrient absorption like Crohn's disease and celiac disease can result in selenium
    deficiency. Also, dialysis patients may have lower selenium levels.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can medications affect selenium levels?</h2>
<p>Yes, certain medications, including chemotherapy drugs, can affect selenium levels.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can selenium testing help diagnose any specific diseases?</h2>
<p>Selenium testing isn't typically used to diagnose a specific disease but can help identify a potential cause of
    certain health problems. For example, selenium deficiency might contribute to hypothyroidism, while high levels
    might indicate toxicity.</p>
<p>Understanding your body’s selenium status is crucial in maintaining optimal health. The Selenium, Urine Spot test is
    a convenient and straightforward test that allows for this. Always discuss your test results with your doctor, who
