<div class="post-text">
<p>Brazil nuts, which originate from a tree in the Amazon, are a popular snack and food ingredient. They are a source of several essential nutrients, including selenium, magnesium, and thiamine. However, some individuals may have an allergic reaction to Brazil nuts, which can cause various symptoms, from mild to severe.</p>

<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Brazil Nut test is a diagnostic tool that measures the levels of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood. When the immune system mistakenly recognizes the proteins in Brazil nuts as harmful, it triggers the production of IgE antibodies, leading to an allergic reaction.</p>
