<h1 class="test-h1">Homocysteine, Urine </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p><strong>Homocysteine</strong> is an amino acid produced by the body, usually as a byproduct of consuming meat. High levels of homocysteine in the urine can indicate a deficiency in the vitamins B6, B12, or folic acid, all of which are used by the body to break down homocysteine. It can also suggest potential kidney problems or a rare genetic disorder called homocystinuria. This test is used to help identify vitamin deficiencies, assess kidney function, and diagnose certain genetic disorders. </p>
<p>The levels of <strong>homocysteine</strong> in the body are primarily influenced by the diet and by genetic factors. Elevated levels can increase the risk of damage to the arteries, which could result in blood clots, heart disease, and stroke. On the other hand, very low levels of homocysteine are associated with certain neurological conditions, like Parkinson's disease </p>
