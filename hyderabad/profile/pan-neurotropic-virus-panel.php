								<p>The Pan Neurotropic Virus Panel is a comprehensive test that screens for a variety of viruses that can affect the nervous system. These include, but are not limited to, herpes simplex viruses, enteroviruses, arboviruses, and others. These viruses can cause a range of conditions from mild illness to severe neurological diseases such as meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis.</p>
								<p>Understanding your viral exposure can be particularly useful if you're experiencing symptoms of a neurological infection, such as headache, fever, confusion, seizures, or weakness. It can also be helpful in guiding treatment decisions and assessing the risk of complications.</p>
