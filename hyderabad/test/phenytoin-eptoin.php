							<p>Phenytoin, also known by its brand name Eptoin, is a medication primarily used to treat
								and prevent seizures. It can be used in the treatment of both generalized and partial
								seizures and is part of a class of drugs known as anticonvulsants or antiepileptic
								drugs. The Phenytoin (Eptoin) blood test is utilized to monitor the levels of phenytoin
								in the blood to ensure the dosage is effective yet safe.
							</p>
							<p>
								Phenytoin works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain, preventing
								seizures from occurring. However, the therapeutic range of phenytoin is narrow, meaning
								there is only a small difference between a beneficial and a potentially harmful level.
								Therefore, regular monitoring through the Phenytoin (Eptoin) blood test is important to
								ensure that the drug is doing its job without causing harm to the body.
