								<p>The <strong>AFB/TB Susceptibility: Ofloxacin (Rapid- MGIT)</strong> test is a critical diagnostic tool utilized in the fight against Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease primarily affecting the lungs, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This test discerns the susceptibility or resistance of the bacteria to Ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used in the management of TB, particularly in cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). The information obtained from this test allows healthcare professionals to design appropriate and effective treatment plans.</p>
								<p>This test utilizes the MGIT (Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube) methodology, a rapid, fully automated system for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical specimens and for testing their susceptibility to Ofloxacin. Early and accurate detection of drug resistance is crucial in initiating the right treatment, preventing the spread of the disease, and combatting the emergence of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB).</p>
