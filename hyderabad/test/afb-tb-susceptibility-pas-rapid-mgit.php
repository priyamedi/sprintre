								<p><strong>The AFB/TB Susceptibility: PAS (Rapid- MGIT)</strong> test is a vital diagnostic instrument used in managing Tuberculosis (TB), a serious infectious disease mainly targeting the lungs and caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This test determines the susceptibility or resistance of the bacteria to Para-AminoSalicylic Acid (PAS), a second-line antibiotic commonly employed in the treatment of TB, especially in multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases. The insights gleaned from this test enable healthcare </p>
								<p>This test employs the MGIT (Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube) methodology, a speedy, fully automated system for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical specimens and for testing their susceptibility to PAS. Swift and accurate detection of drug resistance is crucial for initiating appropriate treatment, preventing the disease's spread, and combatting the rise of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB).</p>
