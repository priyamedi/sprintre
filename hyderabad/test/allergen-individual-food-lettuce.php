<h1 class="test-h1">Allergen, Individual - Food Lettuce </h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Lettuce test is conducted to determine if an individual is allergic to lettuce. Lettuce, a leafy green vegetable, is widely used in salads and sandwiches. While uncommon, some people may have an allergy to lettuce. This allergy occurs when the immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in lettuce as harmful, triggering an allergic reaction. The test measures the presence of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood that react to proteins in lettuce.
 </p>
<p>Lettuce allergies can range from mild to severe. Recognizing and understanding lettuce allergies is important for those who experience symptoms so that they can take necessary precautions and seek appropriate treatment.
