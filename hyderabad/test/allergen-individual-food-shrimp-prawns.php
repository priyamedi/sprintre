<div class="post-text">
<p>Shrimp and prawns are popular seafood items enjoyed by many across the globe. However, for some individuals, consuming shrimp or prawns can cause an allergic reaction. This happens because their immune system incorrectly recognizes proteins in shrimp and prawns as harmful substances. The Allergen, Individual - Food Shrimp/Prawns test is crucial in detecting an allergy to shrimp and prawns.</p>
<p>This test is carried out through a blood sample and it identifies the presence of antibodies that are produced in response to proteins found in shrimp and prawns. A positive result indicates an allergy and the individual must be cautious about consuming shrimp, prawns, and related products.</p>
