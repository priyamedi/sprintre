<div class="post-text">
<p>The Prealbumin Test, also known as Transthyretin Test, is a laboratory investigation used to evaluate the body's protein status and nutritional state. Prealbumin is a protein made in the liver and released into the bloodstream. It helps carry thyroid hormones and vitamin A in the body.</p>

<p>Prealbumin levels can provide insight into various health conditions. Low levels may indicate malnutrition, liver disease, or an inflammatory condition, while high levels can be associated with kidney disease or hyperthyroidism. Monitoring prealbumin levels is crucial, especially for individuals receiving long-term nutritional support or those suspected of having a protein-losing condition.</p>
