<div class="post-text">
<p>Pistachios are nutritious nuts that are popular for their rich taste and health benefits. They are packed with vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats. However, some individuals may have an allergic reaction to pistachios. This allergy occurs when the immune system wrongly identifies the proteins in pistachios as harmful and mounts an immune response. The Allergen, Individual - Food Pistachio test is designed to determine whether an individual has an allergy to pistachios by detecting specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies in the blood.</p>
<p>Pistachio allergy can manifest with a variety of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe. It is crucial to understand the symptoms and know how to manage them to prevent serious health consequences.
