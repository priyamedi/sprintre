<div class="post-text">
<p>The Cortisol Free, Urine 24 Hours Test measures the amount of cortisol present in the urine over a 24-hour period. Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, located above the kidneys. It is essential for various bodily functions, including metabolism, immune response, blood pressure regulation, and the body’s response to stress.</p>

<p>This test is particularly useful in diagnosing and managing disorders that involve abnormal cortisol levels, such as Cushing's syndrome (where the body produces too much cortisol) and Addison's disease (where the body doesn’t produce enough cortisol). By collecting urine over 24 hours, the test provides a more comprehensive picture of cortisol production as its levels can vary throughout the day.</p>
