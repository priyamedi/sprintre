<div class="post-text">
<p>DMD (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) Related Dilated Cardiomyopathy refers to a heart condition associated with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by muscle degeneration and weakness. It is caused by the absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. Dilated Cardiomyopathy involves the weakening of the heart muscle, particularly the main pumping chamber, the left ventricle. As a consequence, the heart cannot pump blood efficiently, which may affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems.</p>
<p>DMD-related Dilated Cardiomyopathy is a major concern for individuals with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. It occurs because, in DMD, the heart muscle is also affected by the lack of dystrophin protein. The testing for DMD-related Dilated Cardiomyopathy involves genetic testing, cardiac imaging, and sometimes blood tests for cardiac biomarkers. </p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is DMD-Related Dilated Cardiomyopathy?</h2>
<p>DMD-Related Dilated Cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart becomes enlarged and cannot pump blood effectively,
    often seen in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy due to the absence of dystrophin protein.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is DMD-Related Dilated Cardiomyopathy diagnosed?</h2>
<p>It is diagnosed through a combination of genetic testing, echocardiogram, and sometimes blood tests that measure
    levels of certain proteins that might be indicative of heart muscle strain or damage.</p>

<p>Complications include heart failure, arrhythmias, blood clots, and issues in other organs due to poor blood
    circulation.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is this condition hereditary?</h2>
<p>Yes, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a genetic condition, and the related Dilated Cardiomyopathy is a consequence of
    the muscle degeneration caused by DMD.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What type of doctor should I see if I suspect I have DMD-Related Dilated Cardiomyopathy?
</h2>
<p>A cardiologist should be consulted if DMD-Related Dilated Cardiomyopathy is suspected, especially one who has
    experience with muscular dystrophy-related heart conditions.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can DMD-Related Dilated Cardiomyopathy affect children?</h2>
<p>Yes, it can affect children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and heart monitoring should start early in life for
