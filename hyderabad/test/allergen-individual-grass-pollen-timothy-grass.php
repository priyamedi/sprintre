<div class="post-text">
<p>Timothy Grass, scientifically known as Phleum pratense, is a perennial grass that is widely cultivated as hay for animals. It is also found in natural meadows and grasslands. Like other grasses, Timothy Grass produces pollen which is released into the air, mainly during the late spring and early summer. This pollen can cause allergic reactions in certain individuals. Such allergies occur when the immune system mistakes the harmless pollen as a threat and releases antibodies to attack it. This release causes the symptoms of an allergic reaction. </p>
