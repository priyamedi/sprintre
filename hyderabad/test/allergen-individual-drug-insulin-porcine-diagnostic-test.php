					<div class="post-text">
								<p>The Allergen, Individual - Drug Insulin Porcine Diagnostic Test is an important medical evaluation aimed at identifying whether an individual has an allergic reaction to porcine insulin. Porcine insulin, derived from pigs, is often used in the management of diabetes. This test measures the levels of specific antibodies produced by the immune system in response to porcine insulin. <br><br>
Allergies occur when your immune system overreacts to substances that are usually harmless. In the case of porcine insulin, the immune system generates antibodies to fight off the perceived threat, which can lead to symptoms ranging from mild, such as a rash or itching, to severe and potentially life-threatening.
