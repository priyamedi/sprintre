						<div class="post-text">
							<p>Common Reed Grass, known scientifically as Phragmites australis, is a tall perennial
								grass that grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. It is widely spread across
								various regions and can be recognized by its feathery plume-like seed heads. While
								Common Reed Grass plays an important role in the ecosystem, it is also a source of
								pollen that can be allergenic to some individuals. The Allergen, Individual - Grass
								Pollen Common Reed Grass test is conducted to ascertain if an individual is allergic to
								the pollen of this specific grass by detecting the presence of Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
								antibodies in the blood.
							</p>
							<p>
								When the immune system of a person who is allergic to Common Reed Grass pollen
								encounters this allergen, it reacts by producing IgE antibodies. These antibodies
								trigger the release of chemicals such as histamine, which subsequently causes allergy
								symptoms. These symptoms can range from mild, such as sneezing and itchy eyes, to severe
								cases like asthma.
