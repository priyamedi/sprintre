<div class="post-text">
<p>The Cortisol Suppression by Dexamethasone, Overnight Low Dose Test, often known as the Low Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test, is used to evaluate the adrenal glands' function by measuring how well they respond to the drug dexamethasone. This test is particularly beneficial in diagnosing disorders associated with excessive cortisol levels, such as Cushing's syndrome.</p>

<p>Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, situated above the kidneys. It plays a vital role in metabolism, immune response, blood pressure regulation, and stress response. Dexamethasone is a medication that mimics the effects of cortisol and typically suppresses its production in healthy individuals. In this test, a low dose of dexamethasone is administered, and cortisol levels are measured the following morning.</p>
