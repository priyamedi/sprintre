</h1>
<div class="post-text">
<p>The Allergen, Individual - Food Lemon test is a diagnostic tool used to identify if an individual has an allergy to lemons. Lemons are a common citrus fruit used in various dishes and drinks for their tangy flavor and high vitamin C content. However, some individuals may have an allergy to lemons, which can cause various symptoms ranging from mild to severe. This test detects the presence of specific IgE antibodies in the blood, which are produced in response to an allergen. In the case of a lemon allergy, these antibodies react with proteins in lemons.
 </p>
<p>An allergy to lemons is part of citrus allergies, which may also include allergies to oranges, limes, and grapefruits. When a person with a lemon allergy consumes lemons or lemon-containing products, the immune system mistakenly identifies certain proteins in lemons as harmful, leading to an allergic reaction.
