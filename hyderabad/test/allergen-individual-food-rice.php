<div class="post-text">
<p>Rice is a staple food for a significant portion of the world's population. However, some individuals may experience allergic reactions when they consume rice or rice products. This reaction is because of an abnormal response of the body’s immune system to proteins found in rice. The Allergen, Individual - Food Rice test is an important diagnostic tool that helps in identifying if a person is allergic to rice.</p>
<p>This test is carried out by taking a blood sample from the patient and analyzing it for the presence of antibodies that are specific to rice proteins. When the body’s immune system identifies these proteins as harmful, even though they are not, it reacts by producing antibodies. This immune response leads to the symptoms of an allergy.
