<div class="post-text">
<p>Testosterone is a vital hormone that plays a significant role in various body functions. It's primarily produced in the testes in men, while in women, it's produced in smaller amounts in the ovaries. Testosterone is crucial for the development of male growth and masculine characteristics. For women, testosterone is involved in bone health, ovarian function, and sexual drive or libido. </p>
<p>The Testosterone Total and Free test measures both the total testosterone, which includes the testosterone bound to proteins, and free testosterone, which is the testosterone that is unbound and bioavailable. This test is beneficial to diagnose various medical conditions related to testosterone in both men and women. </p>
