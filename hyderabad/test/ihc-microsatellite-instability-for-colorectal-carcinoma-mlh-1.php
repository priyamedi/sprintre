	<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What is the IHC - MLH1 test?</h2>
	<p>
The <strong>IHC - MLH1 test</strong> uses immunohistochemistry to detect the presence of the MLH1 protein in tumor
tissues. It is used to assess the microsatellite instability status in cases of colorectal cancer.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Why is the IHC - MLH1 test important?</h2>
<p>
This test is important because it helps in determining the prognosis and guiding the treatment decisions
for patients with colorectal cancer.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is any special preparation needed for the test?</h2>
<p>
No special preparation is needed as the sample is usually taken during a biopsy or surgery.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What does it mean if the MLH1 protein is absent?</h2>
<p>
Absence or reduced expression of the MLH1 protein can indicate the presence of microsatellite
instability, which has implications on the prognosis and treatment options.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Is IHC - MLH1 test the only test used to assess microsatellite instability?</h2>
<p>
No, there are other tests like PCR-based tests for MSI, and often testing for multiple mismatch repair
proteins is done concurrently.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I have the IHC - MLH1 test done?</h2>
<p>
This test is usually performed once, typically when diagnosing colorectal cancer. However, your
healthcare provider will guide you based on your individual case.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What factors can affect the levels of MLH1 protein?</h2>
<p>
Genetic mutations, methylation of the MLH1 gene, and certain environmental factors can affect the
levels of MLH1 protein.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Who should I consult if the MLH1 protein is absent?</h2>
<p>
If the MLH1 protein is absent, you should consult with your oncologist who will guide you on the next
steps, which may include further genetic testing and personalized treatment options.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for IHC - MLH1 test?</h2>
<p>

In a healthy tissue, MLH1 protein is usually present. Absence or significantly reduced expression of
MLH1 protein in tumor tissue is indicative of microsatellite instability and can suggest Lynch syndrome, a
form of hereditary colorectal cancer.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there any side effects or risks associated with the IHC - MLH1 test?</h2>
<p>
As the test is performed on a tissue sample, there are no direct side effects. However, the tissue sample
collection through a biopsy or surgery may have associated risks.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What is the role of MLH1 protein in the body?</h2>
<p>
MLH1 protein is crucial for DNA mismatch repair - a process that corrects errors made during DNA
replication. This function helps maintain the stability of the cell's genetic material. If MLH1 protein is
absent or not functioning properly, these errors may not be corrected, leading to genetic mutations that
can cause cancer.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can lifestyle changes affect the levels of MLH1 protein?</h2>
<p>
The levels of MLH1 protein are primarily determined by genetic factors. However, certain environmental
exposures like smoking or a diet low in folate have been associated with MLH1 gene silencing, which
could potentially impact the protein levels.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can IHC - MLH1 test detect other cancers apart from colorectal cancer?</h2>
<p>
Yes. While it's most commonly used in the context of colorectal cancer, IHC - MLH1 can also be useful in
the diagnosis of other cancers, such as endometrial cancer, where MLH1 protein loss is also seen.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Is the IHC - MLH1 test definitive for diagnosing microsatellite instability?</h2>
<p>
While <strong>IHC - MLH1 test</strong> provides valuable information, it's typically used in conjunction with other tests
for a more comprehensive assessment of microsatellite instability. This can include testing for other
mismatch repair proteins and molecular tests like PCR for microsatellite instability.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can the IHC - MLH1 test be used to monitor treatment progress?</h2>
<p>
Typically, IHC - MLH1 is not used for monitoring treatment progress. However, changes in MLH1
expression could potentially be studied in research settings to understand the impact of certain
treatments on microsatellite instability.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> What happens if my IHC - MLH1 test results are abnormal?</h2>
<p>
Abnormal results, specifically reduced or absent expression of MLH1 protein, may suggest a diagnosis of
microsatellite instability or Lynch syndrome. If this happens, your doctor will discuss the results with you
and guide you on the next steps, which could include further testing or consultations with a genetic
counselor.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> How reliable is the IHC - MLH1 test?</h2>
<p>
The <strong>IHC - MLH1 test</strong> is a reliable and well-established method for detecting the presence of MLH1
protein. However, the results should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory
findings.</p>

<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Are there other tests that can be done if the IHC - MLH1 test is not conclusive?</h2>
<p>
Yes, molecular tests such as PCR for microsatellite instability or genetic testing for Lynch syndrome may
be performed if the results of the IHC - MLH1 test are inconclusive or if further information is required.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Can the IHC - MLH1 test determine if my cancer is hereditary?</h2>
<p>
If the IHC - MLH1 test shows absent or reduced MLH1 protein expression, it could suggest a hereditary
form of colorectal cancer known as Lynch syndrome. However, further genetic testing is usually required
to confirm this diagnosis.</p>
<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Who will interpret the results of the IHC - MLH1 test?</h2>
<p>
The results of the IHC - MLH1 test are typically interpreted by a pathologist who specializes in cancer
diagnosis. The pathologist's report will then be used by your treating physician to understand the
disease better and to decide the next course of action.</p>
<p>The importance of the <strong>IHC - MLH1 test</strong> in the diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer cannot be
overstated. By assessing the presence or absence of MLH1 protein, this test offers insights into the
likelihood of a patient having microsatellite instability or Lynch syndrome, both of which have significant
implications for treatment and prognosis. While the test itself may not offer a complete picture of the
patient's condition, it is an essential component of a comprehensive diagnostic process. If you have
been recommended this test, rest assured that it will contribute valuable information to guide your
healthcare journey.
