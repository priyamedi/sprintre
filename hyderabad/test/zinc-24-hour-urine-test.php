					<div class="post-text">
						<p>The Zinc - 24 Hour Urine Test is a diagnostic test used to evaluate the levels of zinc, an essential mineral, in the body. Zinc plays vital roles in various biological processes, including immune function, wound healing, cell division, and protein synthesis. An imbalance of zinc—whether too much or too little—can lead to health problems.</p>
						<p>A 24-hour urine zinc test measures the amount of zinc excreted in urine over a 24-hour period. This test is typically used when a healthcare provider suspects a zinc deficiency or excess. Proper assessment of zinc status can aid in the diagnosis of several health conditions and support optimal health management.</p>
