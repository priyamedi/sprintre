						<div>
							<p>The Allergy Veg Non-Veg Panel by ELISA method is a diagnostic tool used to identify
								specific allergies to various vegetable and non-vegetable (animal) products. ELISA
								stands for Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, a test that measures the immune system's
								response to specific allergens.
							</p>
							<p>
								Allergies are immune reactions to substances that are generally not harmful. They can
								cause various symptoms, including sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, a runny nose, hives,
								or in severe cases, difficulty breathing. This panel helps identify specific food
								allergens causing these symptoms, thereby assisting in proper management and treatment
								of the allergic reactions.This test detects specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies
								in your blood. Your immune system produces these IgE antibodies when it recognizes an
								allergen. These antibodies then cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction. By
								identifying the presence and amount of these antibodies, the test can confirm whether
								you are allergic to certain types of foods.
							</p>
							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Specific Instructions:</h2>
							<p>No fasting is required for this test. However, if you are currently on any medication,
								especially antihistamines, you should inform your doctor as certain drugs may interfere
								with the test results.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How is the Allergy Veg Non-Veg Panel by ELISA method performed?
							</h2>
							<p>This test is performed using a blood sample. A healthcare professional will collect the
								sample, which is then sent to a laboratory for analysis.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What does this test measure?</h2>
							<p>The test measures the level of specific IgE antibodies in your blood. These antibodies
								are produced by your immune system in response to exposure to allergens in certain
								vegetable and non-vegetable foods.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">When should I consider getting this test?</h2>
							<p>If you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction after eating certain foods, you should
								consider getting this test. Common symptoms include itching, swelling, hives, or
								difficulty breathing.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How often should I get tested?</h2>
							<p>The frequency of testing depends on your symptoms and your doctor's advice. If you're
								undergoing immunotherapy treatment for allergies, your doctor may recommend regular
								testing to monitor your progress.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What precautions should I take before the test?</h2>
							<p>Inform your doctor about any medications you're currently taking, as they could affect
								the test results.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What are the normal values for this test?</h2>
							<p>Normal values can vary between laboratories. Generally, a low level or absence of
								specific IgE antibodies in your blood indicates a non-allergic response to the tested
								foods.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">What factors can affect the test results?</h2>
							<p>Various factors can influence your test results, including recent exposure to allergens,
								certain medications, and some health conditions like autoimmune diseases or infections.
							</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">Can I be allergic to more than one type of food?</h2>
							<p>Yes, it's possible to be allergic to multiple types of foods. This test can help identify
								which specific foods are causing your allergic reactions.</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3">How can I prevent allergic reactions to certain foods?</h2>
							<p>The best way to prevent allergic reactions is to avoid the foods that cause them. Once
								you know which foods you're allergic to, you can eliminate or reduce them in your diet.
							</p>

							<h2 class="test-h2 mt-3"> Which doctor should I consult if my test results are abnormal?
							</h2>
							<p>If your test results are abnormal, you should consult an allergist or immunologist. They
								can help you understand your results and guide you on the next steps.</p>
							<p>Identifying the specific foods that trigger your allergies is a critical step in managing
								them effectively. By using the Allergy Veg Non-Veg Panel by ELISA method, you can tailor
								your diet to avoid allergenic foods, thereby reducing unnecessary allergic reactions and
								enhancing your overall quality of life.</p>
